Nvidia has announced that Isaac GR00T N1 — the company’s open-source, pretrained but customizable foundation model that’s designed to expedite the development and capabilities of humanoid robots — is now available. “The age of generalist robotics is here,” says Nvidia founder and CEO, Jensen Huang. “With Nvidia Isaac GR00T N1 and new data-generation and robot-learning frameworks, robotics developers everywhere will open the next frontier in the age of AI.”
During his GTC 2025 keynote today, Huang demonstrated 1X’s NEO Gamma humanoid robot performing autonomous tidying jobs using a post-trained policy built on the GR00T N1 model. “The future of humanoids is about adaptability and learning,” says 1X Technologies CEO Bernt Børnich. “While we develop our own models, NVIDIA’s GR00T N1 provides a significant boost to robot reasoning and skills. With minimal post-training data, we fully deployed on NEO Gamma — advancing our mission of creating robots that are not just tools, but companions capable of assisting humans in meaningful, immeasurable ways.”
You might recall seeing this freakishly lifelike bot a few weeks ago in Nothing’s teaser for its latest phone. We didn’t post it because it looked like another human in a robot suit — thanks, Elon.
Other companies developing humanoid robots who have had early access to the GR00T N1 model include Boston Dynamics, the creators of Atlas; Agility Robotics; Mentee Robotics; and Neura Robotics.
Originally announced as Project GR00T a year ago, the GR00T N1 foundation model utilizes a dual-system architecture inspired by human cognition.
System 1, as Nvidia calls it, is described as a “fast-thinking action model” that behaves similarly to human reflexes and intuition. It was trained on data collected through human demonstrations and synthetic data generated by Nvidia’s Omniverse platform.
System 2, which is powered by a vision language model, is a “slow-thinking model” that “reasons about its environment and the instructions it has received to plan actions.” Those plans are passed along to System 1, which translates them into “precise, continuous robot movements” that include grasping, moving objects with one or two arms, as well as more complex multistep tasks that involve combinations of basic skills.
While the GR00T N1 foundation model is pretrained with generalized humanoid reasoning and skills, developers can customize its behavior and capabilities for specific needs by post-training it with data gathered from human demonstrations or simulations.
Nvidia has made GR00T N1 training data and task evaluation scenarios available for download through Hugging Face and GitHub.

Nvidia showed off its own Grace Blackwell-powered “personal AI supercomputers” yesterday, but it also made another announcement: third-party manufacturers can come and make their own versions as well. So far, Asus, Dell, and HP have come forward showing their own mini PC designs that tout the same GB10 super chip present in the Nvidia DGX Spark (formerly known as Digits).
Asus is among the first to show off its GB10 computer: the Ascent GX10. It’s a mini PC with the same 1,000 AI TOPS processing power and 128GB of unified memory as Nvidia’s Spark. The Ascent swaps the champagne metallic chassis of the Spark with a more consumer-style white plastic-looking design with a carved pattern on top.
Asus isn’t yet taking preorders for the GX10 and hasn’t revealed a price either.
HP has also teased its GB10 mini computer, the HP ZGX Nano AI Station G1n. It resembles the sleek Z2 mini workstation and looks more premium than the Asus one. The G1n looks like something you’d slot into a server rack, which is something you can do with all of these GB10 minicomputers.
Dell is incorporating Nvidia’s AI Superchips into its new hardware naming scheme with the “Dell Pro Max With GB10” (I know, it rolls right off the tongue). Dell’s version is just a plain black box with a power button on top, which may not be the best place for it if used in a server rack. Dell is also already showing off its version of the Nvidia DGX Station, the Dell Pro Max with GB300, a larger workstation computer touting 20 petaflops of AI performance, just like the source material.
Dell says its computers will arrive “early summer 2025.” That’s around the same time Nvidia’s own DGX Spark is coming, too, for which Nvidia has opened reservations. Nvidia said the Spark will cost $3,000.
Asus and HP have not said when theirs are shipping. Lenovo is also expected to build its own GB10 mini-computer, but it has not yet shown off a design or any details like the others.

At Nvidia’s annual GTC conference in San Jose, Calif. today, the chipmaker announced it was teaming up with General Motors to develop next-generation cars, robots, and factories. 
GM says it will apply several of Nvidia’s products to its business, such as the Omniverse 3D graphics platform which will run simulations on virtual assembly lines with an eye on reducing downtime and improving efficiency. The automaker also plans to equip its next-generation vehicles with Nvidia’s “AI brain” for advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving. And it will employ the chipmaker’s AI training software to make its vehicle assembly line robots better at certain tasks, like precision welding and material handling. 
GM already uses Nvidia’s GPUs to train its AI software for simulation and validation. Today’s announcement was about expanding those use cases into improving its manufacturing operations and autonomous vehicles, GM CEO Mary Barra said in a statement. (Dave Richardson, GM’s senior VP of Software and Services Engineering will be joining NVIDIA’s Norm Marks for a fireside chat at the conference.) 
“AI not only optimizes manufacturing processes and accelerates virtual testing but also helps us build smarter vehicles while empowering our workforce to focus on craftsmanship,” Barra said. “By merging technology with human ingenuity, we unlock new levels of innovation in vehicle manufacturing and beyond.” 
GM will adopt Nvidia’s in-car software products to build next-gen vehicles with autonomous driving capabilities. That includes the company’s Drive AGX system-on-a-chip (SoC), similar to Tesla’s Full Self-Driving chip or Intel’s Mobileye EyeQ. The SoC runs the “safety-certified” DriveOS operating system, built on the Blackwell GPU architecture, which is capable of delivering 1,000 trillion operations per second (TOPS) of high-performance compute, the company says. 
Like most automakers, GM has sunk billions of dollars in the development of fully autonomous vehicles — with mixed results. The company’s advanced driver assist feature, Super Cruise, is considered one of the safest and most capable on the market today. But its work to deploy fully autonomous vehicles has been less successful. Last year, GM pulled funding for its Cruise robotaxi company after a number of safety lapses cast doubt on the operation’s future. 
Before it was shuttered, Cruise was exploring developing its own chips to reduce costs for its parent company. The robotaxi startup had been using Nvidia’s in-car computers to power its autonomous vehicles, which executives complained were too expensive. 
GM hopes to improve its self-driving fortunes by selling passenger vehicles with autonomous driving capabilities — though it hasn’t said when or using what technology. 
In a briefing with reporters, Ali Kani, Nvidia’s vice president and general manager of automotive, described the chipmaking company’s automotive business as still in its “infancy,” with the expectation that it will only bring in $5 billion this year. (Nvidia reported over $130 billion in revenue in 2024 for all its divisions.)
Nvidia’s chips are in less than 1 percent of the billions of cars on the road today, he added. But the future looks promising. The company is also announcing deals with Tier 1 auto supplier Magna, which helped build Sony’s Afeela concept, to use Drive AGX in the company’s next-generation advanced driver assist software. 
“We believe automotive is a trillion dollar opportunity for Nvidia,” Kani said. 
GM is the latest car company to strike a deal with Nvidia. The San Jose-based chipmaker has made serious in-roads in the auto industry in recent years, including partnerships with Jaguar-Land Rover, Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, Lucid, Toyota, Hyundai, Zoox, and a host of Chinese EV startups.

                            <p><strong>Content:</strong> <a href="https://gizmodo.com/what-to-expect-at-nvidia-gtc-2025-2000576285" target="_blank">https://gizmodo.com/what-to-expect-at-nvidia-gtc-2025-2000576285</a></p>
                            <p><strong>Article Content:</strong> Nvidia’s been on a roll this year, starting with the announcement and launch of its 5000 series GPUs. However, as the company’s annual GPU Technology Conference (GTC) starts next week, it’s clear that Nvidia has more news on deck. The five-day event, which starts March 17 and concludes March 21 in San Jose, California, consists of a series of workshops, talks, and panels focusing on the company’s future. And while there’s bound to be a ton of exciting news, the conference’s highlight will be CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote address on March 18 at 1 p.m. ET (10 a.m. PT). You can watch the keynote live at Nvidia’s website.
If you’re wondering what Nvidia has up its sleeve, you can take a look at the conference itinerary and make a few educated guesses. Although robotics, quantum computing, and cybersecurity with a dash of autonomous driving are on the agenda, it’s clear that most of the conference is focused on artificial intelligence. The emphasis on AI is no surprise, as the company has been all-in on the technology for several years.
Aside from Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), which uses artificial intelligence to boost in-game frame rates while reducing latency, Nvidia’s also been rolling out AI technology in its enterprise and automotive sectors. And with the very real threat of DeepSeek, Nvidia will definitely have to present a strong plan for competing with the Chinese AI lab. We think this will be one of the main points of Huang’s keynote address.
But we’re not expecting GTC to be a total software affair. The company is likely to announce an update to its Blackwell GPUs. Launched back in 2024, Blackwell is a platform composed of hardware and software designed to handle large language models (LLMs), generative AI, and other intensive artificial intelligence programs. The latest line of chips, including Blackwell Ultra, is slated to launch in the top half of 2025.
Finally, since GTC is at its heart a developer-centric conference, expect to hear about new platforms and tools designed to make it even easier for developers to keep innovating in AI and other areas. And while some workshops sound scarier than others (“A New Era of Generalist Robotics: The Rise of Humanoids”), this GTC looks like it’s on track to debut some exciting new tech.

                            <h3>Nvidia’s RTX 5060 May Have Just Joined the Queue of Hardware Delayed This Week</h3>
                            <p><strong>Content:</strong> <a href="https://gizmodo.com/nvidias-rtx-5060-may-have-just-joined-the-queue-of-hardware-delayed-this-week-2000578802" target="_blank">https://gizmodo.com/nvidias-rtx-5060-may-have-just-joined-the-queue-of-hardware-delayed-this-week-2000578802</a></p>
                            <p><strong>Article Content:</strong> Those hoping to finally see Nvidia’s lower-end graphics cards in-person—or at least see a pretty picture next to the dreaded words “out of stock”—may need to wait several weeks more. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti may not be around this month, as previously expected. The rumor points to further delays from a tech world feeling the impacts of… let’s just call it “geopolitical concerns.”
According to forum posts first reported by Videocardz, we may not see the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti until the middle of April at the earliest. The word comes from a post on Board Channels—a forum that encompasses members with connections to the various graphics cards makers—Nvidia has told all its partner graphics card makers that the 5060 and 5060 Ti were being delayed for one to two months.
The message posted to the forum noted that the RTX 5060 Ti at either 16 GB or 8 GB of VRAM will be pushed to mid-April. The cheaper RTX 5060 may not be around until mid-May. Initial rumors supported a March release, but now Nvidia is reportedly telling its add-in card (AIC) partners that it will give them specific timing at a later date.
These are relatively loose rumors, but the fact that Nvidia did not offer a peep about its lower-end graphics cards at its GTC 2025 conference supports the RTX 5060 timing for April at the earliest. It means we still don’t have an idea about price, but you could bide your time looking at supposed leaked specs.
Nvidia is still dealing with overwhelming stock woes that have limited access to the company’s new Blackwell series, including the RTX 5090, RTX 5080, the RTX 5070 Ti and lower-end RTX 5070. This week, Nvidia cut some prices for the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 in Europe only. In the U.S., some cards are selling for $100 to $200 above manufacturer suggested price, or MSRP.
Nvidia’s best remedy so far has been what amounts to a raffle called “priority access.” This can help beat the scalpers by limiting stock to verified members of the official Nvidia forums. It still doesn’t help the vast majority of customers who want a card get their hands on one. AMD, with its recent Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT, has similarly faced issues with low stocks and inflated prices. AIC maker Yeston told customers on Tuesday that Radeon stocks would stabilize “after April.”
Nvidia joins the laundry list of companies holding back their big budget releases this week alone. Google dropped the first details of its new mid-range phone, the Pixel 9a, only to pull everything and delay its release citing a “component quality issue.” On Thursday, Nothing, the makers of the upcoming Nothing 3a Pro, reportedly delayed preorders for its upcoming top-end smartphone. Android Police first reported on emails sent to customers noting that “due to demand, there will be a delay” and orders are now set to ship April 15.
There’s nothing official to say any of these delays are due to—or exacerbated by—the ongoing Trump tariffs on imports from China. But we’ve heard directly from companies how complicated their supply chains have become, just due to President Donald Trump’s executive orders. Companies would be better off telling customers how it is, but big tech likely does not want to run afoul of the vindictive grievance machine that currently occupies the White House.

Tariff uncertainty has already lost the tech industry over $1 trillion in market cap.

AI companies can’t figure out if the Trump tariffs are about to decimate them – and the fact that no one has a clear answer is sending them, and the tech industry overall, into a confusion spiral. 
The markets are in disarray. Nvidia is down 7.59%, TSMC is down 7.22%. In San Francisco, sources tell us that this isn’t a big deal. But in DC, people are panicking. The core question is whether GPUs – the graphics processing units that are crucial to AI computing and other industries – are exempted from Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs, and the answer is startlingly ambiguous. 
Inside AI labs, researchers expect that their industry will be granted a tariff exemption. “I fully expect this to be a situation where Trump again gives companies he views as important/on his side/whatever a hall pass,” similar to what the President did with Apple during his first term, one source inside a major AI lab told The Verge. 
In Washington, however, nobody seems sure what the current state of play is. The Trump administration spelled out an exception for the semiconductor chips at the heart of a GPU, but for now, complete electronic products that contain chips will apparently be subject to tariffs. And companies that need GPUs for machine learning, deep learning, real-time processing, and much more require not just the chip, but the entire machine built around it. “Most AI GPUs are, I believe, imported not as chips but as servers, largely from Taiwan,” Chris Miller, a professor at Tufts University and the author of Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology, told The Verge in an email. “So these would presumably face the general Taiwan tariff rate” of 32%, currently scheduled to hit on April 9th.
Ordinarily, government agencies might be able to explain what’s happening. But when asked for clarity, a public affairs official at NIST, the agency at the Commerce Department overseeing the CHIPS Act – a $50 billion investment in building chip manufacturing plants on American soil – directed The Verge to the White House. The White House did not immediately return a request for comment. Neither did the U.S. Trade Representative, the agency responsible for creating and executing the President’s tariff strategy. 
While the SF crowd is bullish on getting exemptions, tech lobbyists in Washington are closer to the chaos that is the second Trump administration, and are far too familiar with the president’s mercurial whims and vindictive nature, particularly against the tech industry. The fact that the tariffs are so vague and seem haphazardly thrown together – so haphazard, in fact, that there’s a legitimate argument that they were generated by AI – is only adding to their worries. “Everyone’s asking for clarity” from the administration, one lobbyist at a major tech company told The Verge. “So far, folks are saying that they think we’re okay, but not sure yet.” That’s not exactly a ringing vote of confidence for GPU tariff exemptions. 
The GPU confusion is rippling beyond the AI industry, hitting the Big Tech companies that stock thousands of these devices in datacenters across the country. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft all rely on access to GPUs to prop up their multi-billion dollar cloud architectures. Clearly, the market isn’t confident that their bottom line will weather these tariffs: The so-called “Magnificent Seven”, which includes the three companies above, have lost more than $1 trillion in market capitalization since the tariffs were announced. (Spokespeople for Google and Microsoft declined to comment for this story.) 
The AI industry has reason to think Trump might favor it in particular. Just a few months ago, OpenAI’s Sam Altman and other tech CEOs stood in the White House alongside the president to announce Stargate, a $500 billion datacenter infrastructure project devoted to fulfilling Altman’s demands for “more compute.” The current unclear state of GPUs coupled with the unpredictability of Trump’s tariffs in general, however, could shake their confidence — or at least mean they must renew attempts to curry Trump’s favor.
“If the tariffs are unchanged, we should prepare for a significant increase in the price of electronics.”
GPU juggernaut Nvidia has apparently begun moving manufacturing to the US, which it hopes will help insulate it from the tariffs. Reuters reported last December, for instance, that it was finalizing plans to produce its Blackwell AI GPU chip at TSMC’s Arizona plant, which aims to start fabricating chips this year. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang alluded to this partnership in a recent investor Q&amp;A: “We’re manufacturing in so many different places. We could shift things around. Tariffs will have a little impact for us short term. Long term, we’re going to have manufacturing onshore.” 
The same can’t be said for compute-hungry AI labs, hyperscale cloud providers, or even average PC builders — all of whom might end up paying substantially more for GPUs. “None of this is impossible, but trying to produce every segment of electronics supply chains domestically will produce a staggering increase in cost, especially in the short-term, given that some of the capabilities simply don’t exist domestically,” Miller said. That doesn’t even take into account the tariffs on the raw materials needed to build these machines and plants, or any retaliatory measures: on Friday, for instance, China announced a new set of export restrictions on rare earth minerals, which are crucial for electronics manufacturing. The U.S. currently imports 90 percent of its rare earth minerals from China.
“If the tariffs are unchanged,” Miller added, “we should prepare for a significant increase in the price of electronics.”
But ultimately, fealty to Trump might be more crucial than an appeal to reason. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has pledged allegiance to the new administration, which is important for Anthropic, since it sources some of its compute through Amazon. These deals are fragile, though. A single critical story in Bezos’ paper The Washington Post could lose Amazon (and by association, Anthropic) a tariff exemption, for instance. Anthropic also sources some of its compute through Google; along with Bezos, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai joined the gaggle of tech billionaires behind Trump at his inauguration.
And there are other factors that could indirectly cause problems for these companies, of course — like the US being pushed into a recession that devastates the tech economy. “The second order effects of the tariffs could still be bad,” the AI lab source added.
The market tumbles seemed to have mobilized tech leaders. A group of tech CEOs and finance leaders are on their way to Trump’s private resort, Mar-a-Lago, according to journalist Kara Swisher. The goal seems to be to find some sense in these tariffs — and perhaps some exemptions.

                            <h3>Nvidia’s RTX 5060 and 5060 Ti GPUs May Arrive Real Soon</h3>
                            <p><strong>Content:</strong> <a href="https://gizmodo.com/nvidias-rtx-5060-and-5060-ti-gpus-may-arrive-real-soon-2000574616" target="_blank">https://gizmodo.com/nvidias-rtx-5060-and-5060-ti-gpus-may-arrive-real-soon-2000574616</a></p>
                            <p><strong>Article Content:</strong> Like Bigfoot or the chupacabra, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 is being spotted in the wild by ravenous GPU buyers ready to believe any hint of a footprint indicates how powerful a beast they are. If anything, the latest leaks suggest we may be on track for a full reveal as soon as this week. The first hints of the card found in a pre-built desktop tower indicate the next Blackwell GPU could be relatively cheap, but that may not matter much if Team Green’s next graphics card is limited on VRAM.
French retailers are already promoting pre-configured desktop towers sporting a Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060.&nbsp;As first spotted by the sleuths at&nbsp;Videocardz, there’s an Acer Nitro 50 tower containing a 14th-gen Intel Core i7-14700F CPU alongside Nvidia’s new lower-end graphics card (it’s listed as a PCIe x16 card, which may be incorrect but we’ll find out soon enough). The French seller EvoPC is selling the tower for 1,590 euros, or a little more than $1,737. The jury is still out on whether that config is worth it, even with 32 GB of RAM.
On Thursday, an Acer spokesperson sent us a note saying the Nitro 50 was posted “in error” and the listing has since been pulled down.
A similar config with the Acer Nitro 60 on Amazon containing a last-gen RTX 4060 may go for between $1,520 and $1,541 from various sellers. That may not mean much, considering the Nitro 50 and 60 configs have been around since 2022. Since it’s a French seller, those prices may not reflect Acer’s commitment to a 10% markup for U.S. customers due to Trump tariffs.
The other element the listing potentially confirms is the 8GB of GDDR7 VRAM. Earlier this week, the usually accurate Nvidia leaker that goes by kopite7kimi posted supposed specs for an RTX 5050, RTX 5060, and RTX 5060 Ti. The RTX 5060 may hold 3,840 CUDA cores and a 150 W power draw. That’s a 25% uptick from the Ada Lovelace architecture at the same level from 2022. That sounds good until you notice the 8 GB of VRAM. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 was already relatively limited at higher resolutions, and the squeezed memory didn’t help it.
As for the 5060 Ti, the core counts are less dramatic, going from 4,352 on the 4060 Ti to 4,608. Just remember that core counts don’t offer more than a small window into the full picture of the GPU’s capabilities. The general fear is that the 5060 Ti won’t be a major uplift in gen-on-gen performance, similar to the RTX 4070 Ti Super compared to the RTX 5070 Ti. At the very least, according to the leaks, you can get the RTX 5060 Ti in both 8 GB and 16 GB GDDR7 RAM variants. It will have a 180W power draw.
Like the RTX 5070 Ti, Nvidia doesn’t seem willing to wait to share its “titanium” edition GPUs. If we believe the leaks, other changes will come to Nvidia’s desktop GPU slate. Those leaks indicate the RTX 5050 could come in desktop form, where it was relegated to laptops on the RTX 40-series. That, too, will sit at a mere 8 GB VRAM and 2,560 of the Blackwell CUDA cores. What this means for the low-end GPU is still in flux. Each of these GPUs should be able to use DLSS 4 and multi-frame gen, so we’ll see if that can push the envelope more than it did while trying to eek 4K performance from the 5070.
Meanwhile, AMD seems to have a plan to stick 16GB of GDDR6 VRAM into all its cards. Rumors reported by Videocardz indicate the 9060 wants to compete at the 60-level just as well as it did against the 70s. None of this really changes the landscape until we get an idea about the price. Nvidia still has its work cut out for itself, trying to make sure there’s enough supply for this launch.
Update 03/13/25 at 4:30 p.m. ET: This post was updated to include a note from Acer that the EvoPC listing has since been pulled.

                            <h3>It’s Not Half-Life 3, but You Can Soon Replay Half-Life 2’s Best Levels With Beautiful New Graphics</h3>
                            <p><strong>Content:</strong> <a href="https://gizmodo.com/its-not-half-life-3-but-you-can-soon-replay-half-life-2s-best-levels-with-beautiful-new-graphics-2000575564" target="_blank">https://gizmodo.com/its-not-half-life-3-but-you-can-soon-replay-half-life-2s-best-levels-with-beautiful-new-graphics-2000575564</a></p>
                            <p><strong>Article Content:</strong> If you’re like me, you still hear the squeaking noise from the Half-Life 2 pheropods in your sleep. The game’s famed Nova Prospekt level, involving you conducting the best prison break of all time, is returning and will look better than ever. Next week, PC gamers can grab and play a demo of the RTX Remix version of levels from Ravenholm and Nova Prospekt with all-new textures, lighting, and ray tracing support.
In a blog&nbsp;post, Nvidia said the demo should be available on March 18, and anybody who owns&nbsp;Half-Life 2 should be able to download and play it immediately. You can nab the demo on Steam. The mod should allow players to use more of the capabilities of Nvidia’s most recent GPUs, including multi-frame gen that uses AI to insert multiple frames between generated frames. At 4x frame gen, you may get over 200 fps with ray tracing on.
The video implies you could go from a little more than 30 to 260 fps with DLSS 4 upscaling and frame gen, but things are more complicated than that. In an email, a Nvidia spokesperson told Gizmodo 45 fps is the recommended input frame rate for a smooth frame-gen experience. However, you have to consider game latency. Frame gen can impact PC latency or PCL, so when setting up your game, you want to be within the sweet spot of 30 to 40 ms. 45 fps may be the low-end limit, and 60 fps is your best bet for smooth gameplay without odd visual artifacts and latency issues.
The RTX remix version of Half-Life 2 is being developed by Orbifold Studios, a group of modders and developers who previously worked on projects like Half-Life 2: VR and Project 17. The project goes beyond other similar mods by rebuilding every asset in the original game from 2004. It will also incorporate lighting and ray tracing found in modern games. The addition of Nvidia’s neural shader layer should also enhance the depth of textures from indirect lighting without impacting performance. The new RTX Skin layer also makes skin seem more translucent as it interacts with nearby lighting sources.
DLSS 4 ray reconstruction and transformer model upscaling are supported on all RTX cards. You can only use multi-frame gen on the more recent 50-series. Nvidia has been promoting RTX Remix since 2022. Since then, we have kept seeing glimpses of the Half-Life 2 RTX mod coming up in Nvidia’s press conferences and press notes, but this is the first time players can experience it for themselves. Unfortunately, we’ll still have to wait longer for the full mod.
With the demo, Nvidia is releasing its RTX Remix tools outside of beta. Nvidia has said that the tool is a way of backporting older games into the modern age. RTX Remix categorizes all the textures, models, lighting, and other data into a software suite that lets modders add, modify, or remove elements. The update will also include the capabilities of DLSS 4. These tools allow developers to use the transformer model upscaler, transformer ray reconstruction, and the oft-touted multi-frame gen.
If you haven’t played Half-Life 2, I don’t know what to tell you to finally convince you to try it. It’s one of the major landmark games of the 21st century. It was the most graphically intensive title to hit the scene at the time, but it’s been so long that you can&nbsp;run the game on a reasonably powerful smartphone. There are already a dizzying number of Half-Life 2 graphics mods, so many add visual effects, updated textures, and generally improve the game’s look. RTX Remix is still one of the most intensive projects since it uses Nvidia’s tools to add ray tracing and other visual effects that were not possible back in 2004.
Beyond Half-Life, Nvidia is also launching its first instances of its ACE AI NPCs, which were first shown at CES earlier this year. We weren’t nearly as impressed as Nvidia thought we would be by its attempts to shove large language models into games, particularly with the&nbsp;Sims-like inZOI NPCS that use AI to guide behavior. A new trailer for FPS Black Vultures: Prey of Greed implies each player will have their own AI as a companion to warn players of enemies or offer advice. The trailer didn’t show any actual gameplay, and knowing AI, it will likely not be fast enough to respond immediately to players’ whims. The only thing I want from AI is its ability to shout, “We’re screwed,” as we are about to get wiped out.
Update 03/13/25 at 3:23 p.m. ET: This story was updated to clarify the note about frame generation and the recommended 45 or 60 FPS,

﻿The Trump administration is imposing more restrictions to prevent advanced US chips from being used by foreign militaries.
by  Jess Weatherbed
The US has added 80 organizations and companies to a trading export blacklist in an effort to prevent China from acquiring computing technology for military purposes. The new restrictions announced by the US Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) are the latest attempt to block foreign access to cutting-edge American chips, despite prior objections from Nvidia and semiconductor industry groups.
More than 50 of the new entities added to the list are based in China, with others located in Iran, Taiwan, Pakistan, South Africa, and the United Arab Emirates. BIS says the restrictions have been applied to entities that acted “contrary to US national security and foreign policy,” and are intended to hinder China’s ability to develop high-performance computing capabilities, quantum technologies, advanced artificial intelligence, and hypersonic weapons.
“American technology should never be used against the American people,” said Jeffrey Kessler, Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security. “BIS is sending a clear, resounding message that the Trump administration will work tirelessly to safeguard our national security by preventing U.S. technologies and goods from being misused for high performance computing, hypersonic missiles, military aircraft training, and UAVs that threaten our national security.”
Six of the newly blacklisted entities are subsidiaries of Inspur Group — China’s leading cloud computing service provider and a major customer for US chip makers such as Nvidia, AMD, and Intel — which BIS alleges had contributed to projects developing supercomputers for the Chinese military. The Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence is another addition to the list, which has criticized its inclusion.
“We are shocked that a private non-profit scientific research institution has been added to the entity list,” the research institute said in a statement to the Associated Press. “We strongly oppose this wrong decision without any factual basis and ask the relevant US departments to withdraw it.”
China’s Foreign Ministry has also condemned the export controls, saying the blacklist expansion “seriously violates international law and basic norms of international relations.” The updated export restrictions come amid already heated tensions between the US and China, with President Trump having imposed sweeping new tariffs against goods coming from the country since taking office.

The ‘free speech’ investigation goes hunting at Apple, OpenAI, and 14 other companies.
by  Tina Nguyen
On Friday, Rep. Jim Jordan, the Republican Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, upped his investigations into Big Tech by sending subpoenas to 16 major tech companies, asking whether the federal government had pressured them into using artificial intelligence to “censor lawful speech” – a new front in his long-running quest to prove the tech industry is out to silence conservatives.
In letters accompanying the subpoenas, Jordan asked the companies – Adobe, Alphabet, Amazon, Anthropic PBC, Apple, Cohere, International Business Machines Corp., Inflection AI, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Open AI, Palantir Technologies, Salesforce, Scale AI, and Stability AI – to preserve all documents between them and the Biden-Harris administration that showed “how and to what extent the executive branch coerced or colluded with artificial intelligence (AI) companies and other intermediaries to censor lawful speech.” The core of their claim: algorithms could be used to discriminate against right wingers not just online, but in any everyday use case for AI, from hiring practices to generative content. 
Citing a report filed last December, in which the committee found several alleged examples of Biden officials “pressuring private companies to ‘advance equity,’ stop ‘algorithmic discrimination,’ and ‘mitigate the production of harmful and biased outputs,’” Jordan demanded they produce any and all emails with a third party, government or otherwise, between January 2020 and January 2025, “referring or relating to the moderation, deletion, suppression, restriction, or reduced circulation of the content, input, or output of an AI model, training dataset, algorithm, system, or product.” 
The subpoenas are the latest move in the GOP’s long-running and innumerable investigations into whether tech companies were suppressing right-wing ideology on their platforms, and narrowed in on potential interference from the Biden administration over the past several years. But this inquiry is particularly vast: its broad request for any document that ever discussed AI content restrictions over the past five years, as well as its targeting of software companies that are not media platforms, such as Adobe, Nvidia and Palantir, represents the party’s escalation against the industry.

                <p class="wikipedia-summary">Nvidia Corporation ( en-VID-ee-ə) is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, and incorporated in Delaware. Founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang (president and CEO), Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, it is a company which designs and supplies graphics processing units (GPUs), application programming interfaces (APIs) for data science and high-performance computing, and system on a chip units (SoCs) for mobile computing and the automotive market. Nvidia is also a leading supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software. Nvidia outsources the manufacturing of the hardware it designs.
Nvidia's professional line of GPUs are used for edge-to-cloud computing and in supercomputers and workstations for applications in fields such as architecture, engineering and construction, media and entertainment, automotive, scientific research, and manufacturing design. Its GeForce line of GPUs are aimed at the consumer market and are used in applications such as video editing, 3D rendering, and PC gaming. With a market share of 80.2% in the second quarter of 2023, Nvidia leads global sales of discrete desktop GPUs by a wide margin. The company expanded its presence in the gaming industry with the introduction of the Shield Portable (a handheld game console), Shield Tablet (a gaming tablet), and Shield TV (a digital media player), as well as its cloud gaming service GeForce Now.
In addition to GPU design and outsourcing manufacturing, Nvidia provides the CUDA software platform and API that allows the creation of massively parallel programs which utilize GPUs. They are deployed in supercomputing sites around the world. In the late 2000s, Nvidia had moved into the mobile computing market, where it produced Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets and vehicle navigation and entertainment systems. Its competitors include AMD, Intel, Qualcomm, and AI accelerator companies such as Cerebras and Graphcore. It also makes AI-powered software for audio and video processing (e.g., Nvidia Maxine).
Nvidia's attempt to acquire Arm from SoftBank in September 2020 failed to materialize following extended regulatory scrutiny, leading to the termination of the deal in February 2022 in what would have been the largest semiconductor acquisition. In 2023, Nvidia became the seventh public U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion, and the company's valuation has increased rapidly since then amid growing demand for data center chips with AI capabilities in the midst of the AI boom. In June 2024, for one day, Nvidia overtook Microsoft as the world's most valuable publicly traded company, with a market capitalization of over $3.3 trillion.</p>
