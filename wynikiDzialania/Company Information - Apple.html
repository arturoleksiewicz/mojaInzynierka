This year’s iPad Air was a surprise to me. Apple launched the last Air less than a year ago, and that was a very good device that could already support Apple Intelligence — and most of Apple’s recent gadget upgrades have been about supporting Apple Intelligence. I figured Apple might launch a better Magic Keyboard for the Air (which it did), and that maybe we’d see some big new software ideas at WWDC this year. But a whole new model? Didn’t see that coming.
In fairness, there’s really only one new thing about the new model: it runs on an M3 chip instead of last year’s M2. So maybe instead of a whole new iPad Air, this is more like a mid-cycle refresh. Apple’s chip production changes, and so its devices change too. The new one, just like the old one, starts at $599 for the 11-inch model and $799 for the 13-inch screen. It comes in the same very pale colors. You get it.
I’ve had a 13-inch M2 Air for many months and an 11-inch M3 Air on my desk for the last several days. The story is the same as ever: it’s an excellent tablet, and I wish Apple would use iPadOS to make it a more versatile one. But we don’t need to litigate the reason for tablets to exist — you want to know if this is the tablet you should buy. 
To that end, I have six thoughts that have come up in my testing that I think add up to something like an answer.

Big Magic Keyboard upgradeFaster chips are always a winiPads are great
Touch ID &lt; Face IDApple Intelligence is not an upgrade$250 more than the base iPad
There’s no meaningful performance upgrade here. The M3 chip inside the new Air benchmarks at about 12–15 percent above the M2 in last year’s model. That’s actually a decent-sized bump, though it’s not the 2x jump Apple promises over the M1 from 2022. (I don’t have one of those handy, unfortunately, so I can’t test that number.) In practice, though, I don’t notice the difference. At all. Apps open at the same speed, games look and play the same, even apps like Procreate and Logic are equally responsive. 
None of that is a problem with the M3, really, just a statement about how good the M2 already was. In general, I’d say the M3 seems closer to the M2 in performance than the M4 iPad Pro, which is still a half-beat faster on just about everything.
Graphics performance can be tricky to test on an iPad since there aren’t that many games designed to push the limits of the device. if I play Call of Duty: Mobile and crank everything to Max settings, I think I notice a slight difference in the details, particularly in shadows. But it’s subtle at best and possibly just a placebo.
But the keyboard is way better. Adding a row of function keys — for controlling volume and playback, opening the app switcher, and quickly locking the device — immediately makes the Air a more credible laptop replacement. (Until now, the Air’s was the only keyboard dock that didn’t have the function keys, which was just weird.) Apple says passthrough charging with the new Magic Keyboard charges the iPad as fast as plugging the tablet in directly, which makes it a really useful dock. It’s way too expensive an accessory, starting at $269, but it’s a very good one. The Pro keyboard is still the best one, though: it’s made of aluminum, has backlit keys and more feedback in the trackpad, and just feels nicer to tap on.
Another nice thing: the new keyboard is backwards compatible, so if you have an M2 Air it’ll work just fine with the new keyboard. In fact, if you can find one on sale, 2024 Air plus 2025 Magic Keyboard might be the Air combo I recommend most.
This thing really, really should support Face ID. Touch ID always made more sense to me on phones, which you typically hold the same way all the time, than on a tablet where notions of “bottom” and “top” are ever-changing. On the Face ID iPad Pro, you hardly ever need the power button; just tap the screen, and it wakes up and unlocks. On this Air, like other Touch ID iPads, it’s just annoying to sweep your thumb around the edges looking for the power button, where the sensor is.
In terms of day-to-day “design is how you use it” features, Face ID is the Pro upgrade I most want to see come to the Air.
Size matters. It might seem silly to say that a 13-inch iPad is very different from an 11-inch iPad, but those two inches of screen size really do change everything. When I use a 13-inch iPad, which is mostly what I’ve been testing recently, I hardly ever pick it up; it’s a desk-bound, keyboard-attached thing. An 11-inch model, on the other hand, is so much easier to hold in two hands (or even in one) that I find myself carrying it around a lot more. 
If you want a larger model, I’d encourage you to consider the 13-inch Pro instead. If you’re thinking about the iPad as a productivity machine rather than a portable consumption tool, you’ll really benefit from the Pro’s better Magic Keyboard, its 120Hz screen, and its performance improvements. If you want something that is essentially your main computer, the iPad Pro is the way to go if you can afford it. But if the versatility of the small screen appeals to you, the 11-inch Air is a really nice option. You sacrifice some space, obviously, and the keyboard attachment is a bit more cramped, but I recommend the smaller models to people for the wieldability alone. I’m convinced that practically every iPad user is best-served by either the plain ol’ iPad or the 11-inch Air.
Apple Intelligence is the open question here. I haven’t been able to try the new base-model iPad yet, but I suspect that its story is fairly straightforward: the A16 Bionic chip is a nice upgrade, and it’ll be great for watching movies, browsing the web, and the other things everybody does on their iPad.
I can’t think of one reason Apple Intelligence would cause you to buy one device over another
But there are a couple of things the base model can’t do, like Stage Manager (not a problem) and the Pencil Pro (maybe a problem!). It’s also the only current iPad that doesn’t support Apple Intelligence. Right now, that does not matter one tiny bit. Seriously: I can’t think of one reason Apple Intelligence would cause you to buy one device over another in the near future. But if you’re bullish on the future of AI and you think Apple Intelligence is likely to be good before you’re looking to upgrade your iPad again, you might want the Air. I have no idea how to handicap the likelihood that AI gets good before your iPad dies — though it’s not a great sign that Apple just once again delayed the Siri improvements that might actually make Apple Intelligence compelling. Either way, that’s the biggest and most consequential difference between the devices right now.
The Air is still a tweener, but it’s a good one. Speaking of longevity: most studies and surveys show that iPad buyers keep their devices for at least three years — and in many cases, it’s more like five or even seven. If you’re planning to keep your next iPad until 2030 or so, I’m confident the M3 Air will last that long. Apple’s M-series chips are terrific and hold up well over time, this Air supports a good Magic Keyboard and the best Apple Pencil you can buy, and other than Face ID and the 120Hz screen, there are no features you’re missing by not buying the Pro. (The Pro is just better at everything.) I still think the base iPad is plenty of iPad for just about everybody, but if you want a nicer screen, a little more processor, and a little more confidence that this thing will last you into the next decade, the Air is a great choice.

Starting in March 2025, Apple will use blurred imagery captured during Apple Maps surveys to improve other services.
by  Andrew Liszewski
Sometime earlier this month, Apple updated a section of its website that discloses how it collects and uses imagery for Apple Maps’ Look Around feature, which is similar to Google Maps’ Street View, as spotted by 9to5Mac. A newly added paragraph reveals that, beginning in March 2025, Apple will be using imagery and data collected during Look Around surveys to “train models powering Apple products and services, including models related to image recognition, creation, and enhancement.”
Apple collects images and 3D data to enhance and improve Apple Maps using vehicles and backpacks (for pedestrian-only areas) equipped with cameras, sensors, and other equipment including s and iPads. The company says that as part of its commitment to privacy, any images it captures that are published in the Look Around feature have faces and license plates blurred. Apple also says it will only use imagery with those details blurred out for training models. It does accept requests for those wanting their houses to also be blurred, but by default they are not.
The Verge has reached out to Apple for confirmation on exactly what models will be trained using the imagery, and will update this story accordingly. Apple Intelligence has several features powered by AI image generation models. These include Image Playground, the Clean Up tool in Apple’s Photos app which can remove parts of an image, and advanced image recognition that improves the Photos app’s search capabilities.

Passwords users were exposed to potential phishing attacks for three months until an iOS 18.2 patch.
by  Wes Davis
Apple fixed a bug in the iOS 18.2 Passwords app that, for three months starting with the release of iOS 18, made users vulnerable to phishing attacks, according to an Apple security content update spotted by 9to5Mac.
Here’s how Apple describes the bug and its fix: 
Impact: A user in a privileged network position may be able to leak sensitive information
Description: This issue was addressed by using HTTPS when sending information over the network.
As 9to5Mac writes, the Passwords app was sending unencrypted requests for the logos and icons it shows next to the sites your stored passwords are associated with. The lack of encryption meant an attacker on the same Wi-Fi network as you, like at an airport or coffee shop, could redirect your browser to a look-a-like phishing site to steal your login credentials. It was first discovered by security researchers at app developer Mysk.
In the description of the below YouTube video demonstrating the bug, Mysk writes that it first reported the vulnerability in September. Apple describes the same bug in security content updates for the Mac, iPad, and the Vision Pro, as well.

The Severance streamer is reportedly the only Apple service that isn’t profitable.
by  Emma Roth
Apple TV Plus is losing more than $1 billion every year despite reaching 45 million subscribers in 2024, according to a report from The Information. It’s reportedly the only Apple subscription that isn’t generating a profit.
As part of an effort to take “a harder line on spending,” Apple cut its initial $5 billion budget for Apple TV Plus content by around $500 million, The Information reports. Even with hit original shows like Severance, Apple TV currently captures less than 1 percent of total monthly streaming services viewership, as opposed to Netflix’s 8.2 percent, according to data from Nielsen cited by The Information.
But, as noted by The Information, Apple TV Plus was largely created to keep people in the Apple ecosystem. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos touched on the strategy behind Apple TV Plus during an interview with Variety this week, saying “I don’t understand it beyond a marketing play, but they’re really smart people. Maybe they see something we don’t,” he said.
Apple TV Plus is part of the company’s broader services business, which makes Apple billions of dollars each year through iCloud Plus, App Store purchases, and search advertising. Sources also told The Information that Apple Music, which reportedly reached 100 million users on subscriptions and free trials last year, has seen a slowdown in growth.
Apple News Plus, Fitness Plus, and Apple Arcade also “struggle with low usage and profits,” while sales of digital books have taken a dip as well, The Information reports. Sources tell the outlet that if these services weren’t included in the company’s Apple One bundle, which people mostly buy for iCloud Plus, they “likely wouldn’t be profitable.” Apple reportedly laid off around 100 people in its News and Books division last year.
The Verge reached out to Apple with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.

In her review of the 2023 edition of the Apple Mac Studio, Brenda Stolyar called the pint-sized powerhouse “the Goldilocks Mac”—suggesting its combination of performance and price was just about perfect for power users, at least those that don’t need the hemorrhage-level bleeding-edge performance of the Mac Pro tower.
Today Apple aims to maintain that verdict, upgrading the device to keep up with the times and again releasing the Studio in two versions, one of which should be ideal for any creative.
The 2025 Mac Studio can be configured either with the new M4 Max CPU or with the M3 Ultra. It may sound counterintuitive, but the M3 Ultra version is the more premium of the two SKUs, by a significant margin; the Ultra design family has been described as merging two Max CPUs that the computer addresses as a single chip. There’s no M4 Ultra CPU yet, so ultra power users get the equivalent of a pair of M3 Max CPUs instead. This isn’t a consolation prize. Most head-to-head benchmarks place the M4 Max as only slightly faster than the 2023-released M2 Ultra, with the M3 Ultra significantly ahead from there. For the moment, Apple bills the new Mac Studio as “the most powerful Mac ever made.”
Like its predecessors, the Mac Studio is a lunchbox-sized device that does not look at all like it should be the most powerful Mac ever made but rather like something that should be operating a really nice stereo system. But looks are of course deceiving, and inside the sealed box you’ll find plenty of oomph, designed with creators firmly in mind. I tested the entry-level M4 Max version, which includes a 14-core CPU, 32-core GPU, and 16-core Neural Engine, plus 36 GB of unified memory and a 512-GB SSD for $1,999. That lattermost spec feels a bit stingy in today’s clime, but it can be upgraded (only at purchase) on the M4 Max model all the way up to 8 TB of SSD storage.
For comparison, the $3,999 M3 Ultra version starts with a 28-core CPU, 60-core GPU, and 32-core Neural Engine, plus 96 GB of unified memory and a 1-TB SSD. Maxed out with an 80-core GPU, 512 GB of RAM, and a 16-TB SSD, your price tag will hit a cool $14,099. The most powerful Mac ever made may well equate to the most expensive Mac ever sold as well.
It perhaps goes without saying that the machine is meltingly fast, to the point where it’s hard to accurately convey its power in text. The M4 Pro-based Apple MacBook Pro I reviewed last fall probably provides the best comparison I can offer, considering it’s only one step down on the CPU ladder from the M4 Max.

On the industry standard Geekbench 6 test, CPU performance was up 17 percent over the aforementioned MacBook Pro, while GPU performance was up a blistering 67 percent. I measured similar score upgrades when testing with Cinebench 2024. This GPU one-upmanship was a common theme throughout my testing. Image and video rendering was blazing, as were other highest-tier graphics and gaming tests I ran—all smooth and unstuttering. As well, on-device tests using Apple Intelligence, namely AI image generation, were far faster than anything I’ve done using online tools. While these two systems are not exactly apples to apples, the step up from the M4 Pro to the M4 Max was as impressive as any generational upgrade I’ve encountered in recent memory.
Apple’s internal benchmarks are equally instructive, as they are based on the two earlier iterations of the Mac Studio, alternately featuring the M1 Max and the M2 Max. Performance deltas vary based on the specific test, but with the M4 Max Mac Studio you can expect roughly double the performance over the M1 Max, and about a 50 percent gain over the M2 Max.
What other upgrades has Apple got in store for you? Not much, to be honest, although this system marks the start of Apple’s big push for Thunderbolt 5, which is supported by all six of the USB-C ports on the device (four in the back, two in the front). If you’re in need of a desk-full of monitors, Thunderbolt 5 will have you covered: Officially you can simultaneously connect up to four 6K resolution displays to the system plus a 4K TV though the HDMI port. The M3 Ultra version can support up to eight displays at once.
Additional ports will look familiar: Two USB-A ports, HDMI output, Ethernet, and a front-mounted SD card slot round out the device. And the rest of the song remains the same. The footprint of 7.7 inches square (and 3.7 inches tall) has not changed, nor has the need for purchasers to provide all their own peripherals. A built-in speaker also remains standard, but it’s really only usable for playing system sounds.
This is the point in the review where I’d normally make my best value analysis and suggest whether the new Mac Studio is worth its $1,999 (base model) outlay. That’s nearly impossible to do with a computer like this, however, because so few users are going to benefit from the extreme power of the M4 Max (and even fewer from the M3 Ultra version). However, I can safely say that if you need this level of performance, you already know that you do, because your existing rig is likely starting to show its age in the face of modern workloads. As such, this purchasing decision strictly comes down to a question of “speeds and feeds.” To that point, the 2025 Mac Studio has plenty going on both fronts.

Apple Intelligence is technically lots of things, but there’s only one feature with the potential to actually meaningfully change the way you use your phone. That would be Siri, which Apple said last year it had turned from a quasi-helpful voice assistant into an AI-powered helper that could understand everything about you and accomplish things on your behalf. Sounds cool, right? It was one of the flagship features of the  16 lineup, a big part of the way Apple promoted its new devices. Except it doesn’t exist. And it won’t anytime soon.
On this episode of The Vergecast, we talk about exactly where things went wrong with Siri — and with the whole gadget industry, which became so enraptured with the promise of AI that it sort of forgot to make good gadgets. Nilay and David discuss the problems and promise with Alexa, the still-enticing ideas behind “ambient computing,” and what it’ll take for Apple to make things right. (Side note: if you haven’t read John Gruber’s essay on the subject at Daring Fireball, you should — we recorded this episode before it published, but it’s an excellent summary of the situation.)

After that, The Verge’s Andy Hawkins joins the show to talk about the state of Tesla. As Elon Musk continues to try and tear down the federal government, his electric car company has become a uniquely politicized thing – there’s just no other way to explain the car show put on by President Trump on the White House lawn this week. Tesla’s rise has in so many ways enabled Musk’s own, and it appears man and company are more closely tied than ever. That might be a problem for the car company.
Finally, in the lightning round, Nilay and David discuss the end of Sonos’s set-top box dreams, some big news in the Home Assistant world, Brendan Carr’s latest regulatory absurdities, what’s next for Pokémon Go, TikTok’s new tool for teens, and Bluesky CEO Jay Graber’s epic sartorial shitpost.

Apple is bringing higher-fidelity audio to its AirPods Max headphones in April, the company announced today. When the $549 headphones switched to a USB-C connector last year, they lost support for wired audio playback — but Apple is about to rectify that with full lossless support, which even the prior Lightning model technically lacked.
“With the included USB-C cable, users can enjoy the highest-quality audio across music, movies, and games, while music creators can experience significant enhancements to songwriting, beat making, production, and mixing,” the company wrote in a press release on Monday. “With this update, AirPods Max will unlock 24-bit, 48 kHz lossless audio, preserving the integrity of original recordings and allowing listeners to experience music the way the artist created it in the studio.” Lossless support “extends to Personalized Spatial Audio,” Apple noted.
Aside from richer sound, the new update enables ultra low latency on the AirPods Max, which makes them better suited for music production, gaming, and live streaming purposes, according to the company.
The firmware update will roll out alongside iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4 sometime in April. You can use a USB-C to USB-C cord for lossless audio, but Apple is also now selling a $39 USB-C to 3.5mm audio cable that shares the same braided design as its other recent cables.
The previous edition of the AirPods Max with a Lightning connector don’t offer true “lossless” playback because of a signal conversion that occurs whenever a wired audio source is used. It’s still better quality than you’d get listening over Bluetooth, however.

I also have for you a terrific new Apple TV Plus show, a deep dive into fax machines, the internet’s favorite new AI plaything, and much more. Kind of a light week this week, honestly, but still lots to dig into. Let’s do it.
(As always, the best part of Installer is your ideas and tips. What do you want to know more about? What awesome tricks do you know that everyone else should? What app should everyone be using? Tell me everything: installer@theverge.com. And if you know someone else who might enjoy Installer, tell them to subscribe here.)
Marina Galperina joined The Verge a few weeks ago as a senior tech editor and immediately started asking extremely fun questions. Questions like, “shouldn’t we do a thing about bird flu?” And “did you know that I once sold a Vine at an art fair?” (And “David, why are all your sentences so bad?”) What I’m saying is, she fit right in.
Marina’s been covering tech and science for a while, but I wasn’t sure if she was a true gadget-head or not. So I asked Marina to share her homescreen with us, to see if I could figure it out. Here it is, plus some info on the apps she uses and why:
The phone:  14 Pro. The screen is kind of crushed, but generally, it’s a fine device and actually fits in my hand!
The wallpaper: It’s a Gothko! Mark Rothko’s Untitled (Black on Gray) that I saw at the Guggenheim years ago. It took me a minute to find the real one online, because before, I used to have to only worry about images of “Rothko-style” copycat prints, and now it’s all this AI garbage stinking up search results. I wanted that specific black on gray thing.
The apps: Way of Life, Photos, Apple Notes, Messenger, Google Sheets, Camera, Signal, Clock, Momence, Apple Fitness, Expense, Google Maps, Slack, YouTube, WhatsApp, Hue, Pocket, Chase, Bluesky, Messages, Phone, Safari, Gmail.
Clearly, I’m really into gamified fitness right now. The Verge’s Victoria Song turned me onto both Apple Fitness and Ladder, and I’m sort of oscillating between the two. I only still have Twitter as an occupational hazard. Otherwise it would be gone. The best (only good?) social network is Letterboxd.
Way of Life — I should explain that one, because it sounds like a cult manual. It’s just a very simple habit tracker that doesn’t just count multiple streaks but generates handy little graphs and charts to visualize your W v. L day ratios. Gamify everything.
I also asked Marina to share a few things she’s into right now. Here’s what she sent back:
Here’s what the Installer community is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well! Email installer@theverge.com or message me on Signal — @davidpierce.11 — with your recommendations for anything and everything, and we’ll feature some of our favorites here every week. For more great recommendations, check out the replies to this post on Bluesky and this post on Threads.
“As Formula 1 season begins, it’s worth mentioning that the best way of following the sport live or through replays for true F1 fans is by using the incredibly cool MultiViewer app. It enables you to use multiple streams and get live timing and tons of other data in real time. An F1 T V subscription is needed, and it also works for IndyCar, NASCAR and WEC.” – David
“This week, I discovered GetInvoice, a tool that extracts invoices and receipts from your emails and web portals. Has saved our company a huge amount of time for tax season.” – Miki
“Amazon’s lockdown of book downloads convinced me to download all my books from various services and put them on a self-hosted server, accessible from my Kobo. So thanks for the nudge, Bezos!” – Dan
“I wanted to recommend Lunatask, which might be the ultimate platform for life tracking. It works cross platform, and it is end-to-end encrypted. It has already replaced Todoist for me, but that’s not all: it also has a Notes tab, which can be connected to your calendar or tasks. It has a journaling space, a mood tracker, a habit tracker, and a relationships tracker (you can get reminders to reach out to your friends to maintain your real-life connections).” – Matin
“Watched Khakee: The Bengal Chapter (available on Netflix) this week. Very good.” – Rahul
“I started using the iOS Journal app and reflecting on my day every day. I don’t write, like, an actual diary, but more looking back at the day to see how productive I am or if I did everything from my to-do list. So far, it helps a lot!” – Colin
“Among the many subscription-based meditation apps, there’s this lesser-known Healthy Minds Program, made by actual scientists and pretty customizable. You can pick your own meditation time for any specific lesson, for example. And it’s completely free.” – Liviu
“Been diving into ‘new’ Game Boy games after getting a ModRetro Chromatic. Besides the official games (my favorites are Dragonyhm and Hermano so far), there are a ton of polished games on itch.io and from other publishers. I had no idea.” – Justin
“I started using Runna to train for a local marathon and was impressed with its commitment to training plans. It gives off a far more serious vibe than Runkeeper (my previous favorite) or the Nike Run app, but it comes with a serious price tag. So far, I’m digging it — but skeptical it’s worth the $.” – Tyler
I talk a lot in this newsletter about some of the things I care too much about. Note-taking apps, for one. Bad shows and movies about cool spies, to name another. But there’s one I don’t talk about much here, and that is my deep and abiding obsession with snacks. Like, I’m the guy who combs the blogs looking for the best finds at Trader Joe’s (Unexpected Cheddar Cheese Spread and the Elote Corn Chip Dippers, you’re welcome), and who will happily try any weird variety of Goldfish or Oreo just in case it’s amazing.
I say this because, one, I want you to send me snack recommendations, and two, I discovered Cabel Sasser’s annual snack roundups and, through them, have both found a ton of good snacks and a new love for snack-related content. Maybe Installer will one day just be about snacks. Or maybe I’m just hungry. Either way, I’m here for all of the internet’s snack content.
See you next week!

 and Android users will be able to exchange end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) RCS messages in the near future thanks to newly updated RCS specifications. The GSM Association announced that the latest RCS standard includes E2EE based on the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol, enabling interoperable encryption between different platform providers for the first time.
The GSM Association said it had started working to enable E2EE on messages sent between Android and  in September last year. E2EE is a privacy and security feature that prevents third parties, such as messaging providers or cell carriers, from viewing the content of your texts. The GSMA says the new RCS standard was developed in collaboration with “mobile operators, device manufacturers, and technology providers,” including Apple.
“End-to-end encryption is a powerful privacy and security technology that iMessage has supported since the beginning, and now we are pleased to have helped lead a cross industry effort to bring end-to-end encryption to the RCS Universal Profile published by the GSMA,” said Apple spokesperson Shane Bauer. “We will add support for end-to-end encrypted RCS messages to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS in future software updates.”
Apple introduced RCS support to s as part of an iOS 18 update in September. While Apple’s proprietary iMessage system already supported E2EE, this wasn’t extended to RCS messaging because the previous RCS standard didn’t provide cross-platform support. Google Messages also enabled E2EE by default for RCS texts, but only conversations between Google Messages users were E2EE, and not those exchanged with iMessage users or users of other RCS clients on Android.
“We’ve always been committed to providing a secure messaging experience, and Google Messages users have had end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) RCS messaging for years,” Google spokesperson Ed Fernandez told The Verge. “We’re excited to have this updated specification from GSMA and work as quickly as possible with the mobile ecosystem to implement and extend this important user protection to cross-platform RCS messaging.”
Update, March 14th: Added statement from Google.

Amazon and Meta shares are down about 7 percent.
by  Todd Haselton
Shares of Apple, Amazon, and other tech stocks are getting walloped on Thursday as the markets digest the impact of President Donald Trump’s new round of tariffs announced on Wednesday evening.
Shares of Apple were down about 9 percent on Thursday morning, which would mark the biggest drop in about five years if it holds until the close, according to CNBC. Amazon shares dropped about 7 percent.
Both companies rely heavily on imports from other countries, like China, on which Trump plans to impose a 54 percent tariff beginning April 9th. Apple also manufactures some products in countries like Vietnam, on which a 46 percent tariff was announced.
The tariffs, if they aren’t walked back, could mean increased prices on electronics for consumers or slimmer margins for companies like Apple and Amazon if they choose to eat some of the costs. Apple has typically had a gross margin, the amount of cash it gets to keep after it sells stuff, of around 38 percent, though it has been higher. Wall Street is likely concerned about lower demand if Apple has to increase the price of Macs, s, iPads, and other products.
Other big tech companies were impacted as well. Shares of Nvidia were down more than 4 percent on Thursday morning while Tesla stock was also down about 4 percent, giving up most of its Wednesday gains. Shares of Meta are down about 7 percent.
