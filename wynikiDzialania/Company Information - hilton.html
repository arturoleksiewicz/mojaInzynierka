Needless to say, the men and women defending our country at home and abroad have an awful lot on their plate. So do their family members, who often go for long stretches with only their phone to connect them with their loved ones. That’s why T-Mobile has stepped up with their special Military Essentials Plan, offering better prices than AT&amp;T or Verizon.
See at T-Mobile
T-Mobile’s plans for military families, veterans, and active service members range from the Essentials Military plan, which is just $90 per month with autopay for a family of three, and go all the way up to the Go5G Next Military plan with annual device upgrades and free Hulu with no ads along with tons of other great perks, and there are other plans in between to give military and veterans a wide range of outstanding choices.
There are four T-Mobile plans available for active duty, veterans, and military spouses, starting with the Essentials Military plan. Moving up the chain, the Go5G Military plan comes with all of the Essentials Military plan benefits with additional entertainment and travel perks, and free Netflix Standard with ads, for just $105 per month with autopay for a family of 3.
The Go5G Plus Military plan offers both new and existing customers the same device deals, along with the New in Two feature that lets you upgrade your device every 2 years, a 50GB high-speed mobile hotspot, and free Apple TV+. The top-level plan, the Go5G Next Military, comes with all of the benefits of Go5G Military Plus along with annual device upgrades and free Hulu with no ads.
T-Mobile’s commitment to bringing the best service on the latest devices for the lowest prices applies to all subscribers, but for our active duty, veterans, and military spouses, they’re going the extra mile with even deeper discounts and up to 30% off on three lines compared to the same plans from Verizon or AT&amp;T.
These plans also come with non-cellular perks, like T-Mobile’s Magenta status which gives access to streaming apps, a 15% off discount at Hilton properties, $5 movie tickets, and more. After confirming with T-Mobile that your device is compatible and your phone number can be moved over, you’re also welcome to bring your device and number when you switch to T-Mobile.
T-Mobile appreciates the sacrifices made by our military service members and their families, and the ones made by our veterans. These discounts are for them as a way to say thank you for their service.

                            <h3>I spent 11 hours at a legal tech conference, and the takeaway was clear: 'Lawyers need to wake up' and use AI</h3>
                            <p><strong>Content:</strong> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/legalweek-legal-tech-ai-main-takeaways-2025-3" target="_blank">https://www.businessinsider.com/legalweek-legal-tech-ai-main-takeaways-2025-3</a></p>
                            <p><strong>Article Content:</strong> On the first day of Legalweek, a conference where thousands of lawyers gather to hobnob with their peers and explore the latest tech, Max Junestrand, clad in a black overcoat that highlighted his 6-foot-3 stature, stepped out of his hotel, ready to seize the day.
Long viewed as Luddites, law firms and corporate lawyers have begun to adopt artificial intelligence to deliver better service faster and cheaper. This has led to a Cambrian explosion of startups trying to sell tools for drafting contracts and tracking billable hours. Junestrand's startup, Legora, seeks to help legal professionals work smarter with a digital workspace built on top of large language models.
Earlier in the day, Legora intensified its battle with a chief competitor by announcing in the trade papers that it had signed Goodwin, a leading law firm for tech deals, as a client. It also opened an office in New York City, the Swedish-born company's first outside Europe. Later in the day, Junestrand would join his employees in Times Square to watch Legora's logo light up the iconic Nasdaq MarketSite screen.
"We don't build Legora so law firms can check the box on doing AI," Junestrand said at Legora's event booth. "We want to transform and rethink what it means to do great legal work."
At Legalweek, held at the New York Hilton Midtown, artificial intelligence was on trial, scrutinized with the precision of a shark litigator. Behind closed doors, lawyers spoke on panels about the coming "death of legal busywork" and the costs of fake legal cases making their way into real briefs. In the exhibition hall, software engineers wearing slacks and pencil skirts tried to woo lawyers with promises to shave off hours of work without killing the billable hour.
I learned that Junestrand has an uphill battle ahead of him. Selling software to lawyers isn't the same as shilling to sales reps or programmers. Lawyers work mostly out of documents. Before the arrival of large language models, software wasn't very good at extracting data from text. So the tools weren't all that useful.
Junestrand said the advent of large models trained mostly on textual data changed everything. Now these models can parse and understand complex legal documents, streamlining tasks like legal research and contract review. But for all the hype around virtual paralegals at Legalweek, numerous lawyers said the adoption of the tech had been slow.
"Lawyers are dinosaurs," an employment lawyer said over a catered lunch of beet salad and deli sandwiches. The Philadelphia attorney said when she gets a contract by email, she likes to print it and mark it up with a pen. When she's done, she files it away. That's how she's been doing things since the Dictaphone.
Later in the week, dozens of attendees poured into a dimly lit conference room for a panel discussion on how legal teams could start using artificial intelligence. Amy Sellars, a panelist and an attorney at the business law firm Gunster, told lawyers to ask vendors for demos and make it easy for people in their firms to experiment with new tools.
"Lawyers need to wake up," Todd Itami, an attorney at the large legal defense firm Covington &amp; Burling, said, adding that learning to use artificial intelligence was "imperative" for their success.
Younger lawyers may be more receptive to Itami's call to action. Aaron Crews, a partner at the global law firm Holland &amp; Knight, places lawyers on a bell curve with early adopters and laggards on the far ends and the rest in the middle. Law students and junior associates often try new products before most others.
The tech-savvy standouts in their programs, Crews said, are likelier to want to work for firms that take a friendlier stance toward new tech. This means the top firms may not be sought after for long if they fall behind the times.

                            <p><strong>Content:</strong> <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/attorney-general-pam-bondi-directs-prosecutors-seek-death/story?id=120374321" target="_blank">https://abcnews.go.com/US/attorney-general-pam-bondi-directs-prosecutors-seek-death/story?id=120374321</a></p>
                            <p><strong>Article Content:</strong> Bondi called Thompson's murder a "premeditated, cold-blooded assassination."
Attorney General Pam Bondi is directing federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty for Luigi Mangione if he is convicted of the December murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, she announced in a statement Tuesday.
One of the federal charges against Mangione, murder through use of a firearm, makes him eligible for the death penalty if convicted.
"Mangione’s murder of Brian Thompson -- an innocent man and father of two young children -- was a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America," Bondi said in a statement. "After careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump’s agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again."
Mangione’s attorney, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, called the decision to seek the death penalty "political," and said it "goes against the recommendation of the local federal prosecutors, the law, and historical precedent."
"While claiming to protect against murder, the federal government moves to commit the pre-meditated, state-sponsored murder of Luigi," she said in a statement. "By doing this, they are defending the broken, immoral, and murderous healthcare industry that continues to terrorize the American people."
"We are prepared to fight these federal charges, brought by a lawless Justice Department, as well as the New York State charges, and the Pennsylvania charges, and anything else they want to pile on Luigi," Agnifilo continued. "This is a corrupt web of government dysfunction and one-upmanship. Luigi is caught in a high-stakes game of tug-of-war between state and federal prosecutors, except the trophy is a young man’s life."
The federal judge in the case already appointed a death penalty expert to the defense team in February.
Mangione is accused of gunning down Thompson outside a Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan as the CEO headed to an investors conference on Dec. 4. He was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania, five days after the murder.
The federal charges against Mangione were filed in December, during the Biden administration.
"As alleged, Mangione planned his attack for months and stalked his victim for days before murdering him -- methodically planning when, where, and how to carry out his crime," then-Attorney General Merrick Garland said at the time.
Mangione has pleaded not guilty to state charges.
He hasn’t entered a plea to federal charges. He is due back in federal court on April 18.

Hilton will open a brand-new hotel in Paris this spring, bringing its luxury LXR Hotels &amp; Resorts collection to the City of Light for the first time.
When the Sax Paris hotel opens in the heart of the 7th Arrondissement, it will mark the first-ever LXR hotel in France, Hilton confirmed to The Points Guy. Currently, Hilton operates 15 LXR hotels around the world in destinations like Las Vegas, Hawaii, Arizona, Japan and Doha.

The company also has plans to open several more LXR properties, including in Morocco, Italy and Japan.
"Each LXR property is carefully hand-picked to ensure that it offers its own enchanting pedigree, story and character that is steeped in the originality of its locale, and Sax Paris is no exception with its unique architectural design and beautiful surroundings," David Heijligers, Hilton's managing director of development in France and Benelux, said in a statement shared with TPG. "As one of the world's major business hubs and leading tourist destinations, we're delighted to be expanding our Parisian portfolio and look forward to welcoming guests soon."
Once open, the Sax Paris will welcome guests to 118 rooms ranging from 258-square-foot king rooms — some boasting views of the city — to over-1,000-square-foot two- and three-bedroom suites with separate living rooms and convenient amenities like all-chrome espresso machines, according to the hotel's website. Rooms will be pet-friendly, too.

Upstairs, the hotel will feature a Japanese restaurant and a bar on the top floor.
The Sax Paris is currently taking reservations for stays starting June 15 with rates starting at $426 or 92,000 Hilton Honors points per night in July, August and beyond, according to a search on the hotel's website.

Next year, Hilton will hit the slopes with the opening of a new Canopy hotel in the popular ski resort area of Deer Valley near Park City, Utah.
The 180-room Canopy by Hilton at Deer Valley is scheduled to open next summer ahead of ski season. It will be themed around the region's transition from an old silver mining area to a world-class ski destination.
During ski season, this Canopy will offer "effortless ski access," according to a statement from Hilton. This includes a ski locker room as well as "a lively apres-ski experience."
But you don't have to love winter sports to enjoy this year-round hotel, which offers a pool and hot tub, a sauna and steam room, a fitness center, and a golf simulator.
Details of the hotel's restaurant and bar offerings are slim for now, but it will include a signature restaurant, an apres-ski lounge, a coffee shop with grab-and-go offerings, and a rooftop lounge.
The Canopy by Hilton at Deer Valley is just one of a number of new hotels popping up around Deer Valley — specifically in Deer Valley East Village, a huge development with shops, restaurants, residential units and year-round recreation.

Deer Valley East Village, 40 minutes from Salt Lake City International Airport (SLC), is redefining the winter sports experience in Utah. Developed by Extell Development (the company behind the Four Seasons Resort and Residences Vail and the Park Hyatt New York, among others), Deer Valley is on a mission to become one of the largest ski resorts in North America. The 2025-26 ski season will see the resort's skiable terrain double and culminate with 5,726 acres of skiable terrain, 37 total chair lifts and a whopping 238 runs.
Don't expect to shred on a snowboard, though: Since 1981, Deer Valley has remained a ski-only resort.

                            <p><strong>Article Content:</strong> Between late March and early May, cherry blossom trees sprout their famous flowers in cities around the world.
Once the flowers open, they don't usually last more than two weeks, sometimes withering within three to five days. Their short seasonal lifespan makes viewing trees in full bloom a sought-after experience that some enthusiasts will cross oceans for.
Aside from creating beautiful spring scenery, cherry blossom-related tourism provides an economic boost to high-demand destinations such as Japan. A record 3.1 million tourists visited Japan during its peak cherry blossom season in March 2024. There's even a special word in Japanese, "hanami," for the country's long-held tradition of cherry blossom viewing.
Washington, DC, another destination known for its springtime blooms, hosts an annual National Cherry Blossom Festival that attracts 1.5 million visitors. Corporate sponsors of the festival include Amazon, Hilton, and All Nippon Airways, a Japanese airline.
Public parks and places of worship in the UK, Germany, and China also feature varieties of the flower. Tourists and locals alike gather to walk along the trees, snap selfies, and breathe in the natural floral perfume.
Photos from around the world show cherry blossoms in full bloom this year. Take a look before they're gone.

An ‘alphabet soup’ of databases, a digital surveillance dragnet, and forced searches of phones have empowered Customs and Border Protection to arrest, deport — and in one case, allegedly torture — noncitizens.
by  Gaby Del Valle
A legal permanent resident claims he was tortured by customs agents after returning home from a trip to Europe. A doctor with a work visa was denied entry into the country — then flown out of the US in spite of a court order halting her deportation. Two German tourists were hassled at a port of entry, then transferred to immigrant detention centers, where they were held for weeks.
President Donald Trump promised mass deportations, vowing to rid the country of so-called “criminal aliens.” But as Trump expands the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) mandate, legal immigrants, too, are finding themselves in the government’s crosshairs. Their arrests are facilitated by DHS’s vast surveillance capabilities, which are largely invisible to the public by design — and where the details of a person’s life, from years-old criminal charges to seemingly innocuous social media posts, are weaponized.
Shocking as they are, these recent events — people with valid travel documents being detained and interrogated, sometimes violently — aren’t entirely unusual. Any noncitizen, including legal immigrants, can end up in deportation proceedings. But Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) apparent crackdown at airports and other ports of entry highlights the latitude individual officers and agents have to enforce immigration law — and in the process, determine a noncitizen’s treatment and fate. 
Two of the recent incidents happened within days of each other at Boston Logan International Airport in Massachusetts. 
The first involved Fabian Schmidt, a green card holder flying back from Luxembourg who was “violently interrogated” by customs agents, as reported by the local radio station WGBH. Schmidt’s partner had driven to the airport to pick him up and ended up calling the authorities after waiting four hours for him to emerge. The only thing they were told was that “his green card was flagged,” Astrid Senior, his mother, told WGBH.
It’s likely that CBP’s databases indicated Schmidt had a prior arrest on his record. The agency has access to state, local, and federal law enforcement databases; for noncitizens, this means even minor infractions can turn an otherwise routine airport encounter into a bureaucratic nightmare.
Schmidt’s mother told WGBH that Schmidt had a misdemeanor on his record from 2015, when he was charged in California for having marijuana in his car. Schmidt was also charged with a DUI about a decade ago, according to his mother. The marijuana charge, however, was dismissed after the state’s laws changed in 2016. 
Customs agents reportedly made Schmidt strip naked, put him in a cold shower, and then forced him onto a chair. Schmidt’s mother said he was held in a bright room with little food or water, where he was denied access to his medication and suffered sleep deprivation. Amid all this, she claims, immigration officers pressured him to give up his green card.
Schmidt, a lawful permanent resident since 2008, is now being held at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center in Rhode Island. 
CBP did not respond to The Verge’s request for comment. Hilton Beckham, the agency’s assistant commissioner for public affairs, told WGBH that Schmidt’s allegations were “blatantly false with respect to CBP” but did not dispute any specific claims, pointing instead to Schmidt’s criminal record as justification for his detention.
“When an individual is found with drug related charges and tries to reenter the country, officers will take proper action,” Beckham said.
CBP officers may have seen Schmidt’s record when he reentered the US — or even beforehand. Officers have access to “a trove of databases” that reveal travelers’ information, Saira Hussain, a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told The Verge.
Air travel provides officers extra time to peruse these records. Where a driver crossing the border can provide a visa or green card on the spot, commercial airlines collect this documentation early and transmit it to CBP via the agency’s Advance Passenger Information System. In either case, CBP will then cross-reference it with what Hussain calls an “alphabet soup” of databases. Officers at any point of entry can use the Interagency Border Inspection System (IBIS) to decide which travelers should be flagged for secondary inspection. According to CBP, IBIS also gives officers access to the FBI’s National Crime Information Center and lets them “interface with all 50 states.” 
“There’s a lot of information that’s at the fingertips of customs officials when somebody is coming into the country, and when they’re looking up information about that individual,” Hussain said.
Some of these databases were used for the no-fly list, Hussain said, while others were used for the FBI’s terrorist screening database. CBP’s rationale for interrogating Schmidt — who has been a permanent resident for six years — has little to do with national security, showing just how entangled the war on terror and the war on immigrants have become in the two decades since DHS’s founding. 
These types of arrests predate the merging of immigration enforcement and national security. When noncitizens enter the US, they’re screened for inadmissibility: reasons they may be excluded from the country. Permanent residents returning to the US aren’t regarded as “seeking admission,” meaning they aren’t subject to the grounds of inadmissibility. But permanent residents with certain offenses on their record — including so-called “crimes of moral turpitude,” which have been grounds for inadmissibility since 1891 despite never having been defined by Congress — are screened for inadmissibility. In other words, Schmidt’s old marijuana charge may have made him inadmissible despite his permanent residency.
Part of the issue is that state laws around marijuana possession have changed since Schmidt’s 2015 arrest, but federal law hasn’t. Matt Cameron, a Boston-based immigration and criminal defense lawyer, said it’s possible that Schmidt’s state-level charge may have been dismissed in a way that still counts as a federal conviction for immigration purposes. Still, Cameron said, the potential for inadmissibility alone doesn’t explain CBP’s aggressive interrogation of Schmidt. 
Cameron said he’s had several clients who have been declared inadmissible due to old marijuana charges. But rather than transferring them to ICE, CBP has typically offered Cameron’s clients what’s called a deferred inspection, asking them to return on a certain date with more documentation. Someone like Schmidt could still be deported if charges were upheld or the conviction involved more than 30 grams of marijuana. But if his record showed dismissed charges for a small quantity, he may well have gone home without incident.
“I don’t know why they put him through all of this,” Cameron told The Verge. “Unless there’s something else that’s not being reported, it is extremely unusual to not just give him a return date.”
Schmidt’s detainment looks far less surprising against Trump’s promises of mass immigrant arrests and deportations. Just days into his second term, ICE implemented aggressive enforcement quotas. Schmidt may be little more than collateral damage — a potentially “removable alien” whose record was on full display thanks to DHS’s surveillance powers.
CBP isn’t just looking for people with criminal records. Border agents regularly search people’s personal devices looking for evidence that can be used to justify their exclusion or removal from the country.
Rasha Alawieh, a physician and Brown University professor on an H-1B visa, was pulled aside for secondary inspection after flying to Boston from Lebanon. Alawieh originally entered the US in 2018 on a J-1 visa. The New York Times reports that she had recently been issued an H-1B visa by the US consulate in Lebanon. CBP detained her at the airport for 36 hours, according to a complaint Alawieh’s cousin filed in a Massachusetts federal court. A judge promptly issued an order barring her removal, but CBP said it was too late — in a sworn declaration obtained by Politico, CBP official John Wallace claimed that by the time agents received official notice, they had already put Alawieh on a flight to Paris.
Amid public outcry, CBP justified its actions by pointing to photos officers had found while searching Alawieh’s phone. A government filing claimed that CBP denied entry after finding “sympathetic photos and videos” of prominent Hezbollah leaders — including Hassan Nasrallah, who was assassinated by Israeli forces in 2024 — on her phone.
“If you refuse a search of your phone or your laptop, customs officers can use that to potentially revoke your visa”
When asked about the photos, Alawieh said Nasrallah and other Hezbollah leaders are considered religious figures in her community, according to court filings obtained by Politico. “So I have a lot of Whatsapp groups with families and friends who send them. So I am a Shia Muslim and he is a religious figure. He has a lot of teachings and he is highly regarded in the Shia community,” Alawieh said, according to a transcript of her interrogation. 
The photos were in her phone’s “recently deleted” folder. But under WhatsApp’s default settings, any photos or videos users receive via the app are automatically downloaded, making them viewable by CBP. 
CBP officials told Alawieh that they were denying her entry into the US and that her visa had been canceled. She is now barred from entering the US for five years.
It’s unclear how CBP agents got into Alawieh’s recently deleted folder, which usually requires a password to unlock. Hussain, the Electronic Frontier Foundation attorney, said people with visas have fewer protections than US citizens and permanent residents with regard to having their devices searched at ports of entry. “If you refuse a search of your phone or your laptop, customs officers can use that to potentially revoke your visa,” Hussain said.
Alawieh’s case also illustrates that consenting to a search can lead to a visa revocation. Even when a phone search doesn’t lead to a deportation, it often will trigger subsequent searches. Hussain called it a “feedback loop.”
“If you’ve been stopped previously and put into secondary screening — which is when the phone searches happen, which is where additional questioning happens — you are more likely to be flagged again for secondary,” she said. “If your phone was previously searched, the contents of that search, as well as notes of that search, will be on various databases that CBP and ICE have access to.”
If Alawieh had never been pulled aside for a secondary screening before, there may have been other reasons she was flagged this time. “It could have been something such as the country that she was traveling from that could have led to heightened scrutiny,” Hussain said. Alawieh’s visa to return to the United States was reportedly delayed in February, while she was in Lebanon. “Our understanding is that this delay was due to increased vetting of Lebanese nationals in case of any security risk, under administrative processing,” her attorneys said in court filings obtained by CNN.
Alawieh and Schmidt’s cases have led to mass public outcry, but they’re not isolated incidents. DHS’s broad mandate — which merges civil immigration processing, the enforcement of transnational crimes, and national security investigations — means that all noncitizens can potentially be caught up in a web of monitoring and surveillance.
There is an algorithmic element to this enforcement: people are flagged for old criminal convictions, for being nationals of countries subject to “extreme vetting,” or simply because they’ve been flagged before. DHS’s access to troves of data means that any noncitizen — even a legal immigrant — who has had a brush with law enforcement could end up interrogated, detained, and potentially deported. 
And DHS is collecting information on people without criminal records, too. Reports suggest that more travelers are being screened at ports of entry. Most recently, CBP denied entry to a French scientist who traveled to Houston, Texas, for a conference. According to the French paper Le Monde, CBP agents searched the scientist’s phone and computer and found messages criticizing the Trump administration’s research cuts, which CBP claims “conveyed hatred of Trump” and “could be qualified as terrorism.” The scientist’s computer was reportedly confiscated.
Since 2019, the State Department has required all visa applicants to disclose five years’ worth of social media history. Though this policy was implemented under the Trump administration, it had been in the works for years. It started in late 2015, with a pilot program to “examine the feasibility of using social media screening” with an unnamed automatic tool, according to a report by the DHS inspector general. Despite pushback from civil rights groups, the program grew until it was applied to the 15 million people who apply for US visas each year.
The Trump administration wants to further expand its social media surveillance of noncitizens. DHS recently proposed similar rules that would apply to people applying for immigration benefits, including citizenship and green cards. Meanwhile, DHS is building out its surveillance capabilities even further. The department is currently developing its Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology (HART), a vast database that will be shared across law enforcement agencies and include not only biometrics like face recognition, fingerprints, and DNA but also details on people’s “non-obvious relationships” as well.
Immigration officers already have access to a lot of that information, but HART promises to bring it all together. In the middle of Trump’s renewed war on immigrants, that makes it all the easier to use.

I don't really like breakfast all that much, and, typically, if I'm eating it while traveling, it's because I have an opportunity to eat a local specialty, like a bagel in New York or pain au chocolat in Paris.
So, perhaps unsurprisingly, when Hilton first eliminated complimentary continental breakfast for Gold and Diamond elite members in favor of a daily per-person food-and-beverage credit at U.S. hotels, I welcomed the change and all the new options it opened up for me and my fellow breakfast skippers.
But even for breakfast devotees, the credit still has some advantages that the old system couldn't match.
Here are a few reasons why my enthusiasm for Hilton's approach to "free" breakfast has only grown in the years since the rollout — and why I think more travelers should embrace them.
Related: I tried out the new Hilton Honors 'breakfast' benefit — and I'm a fan
As a self-professed hotel fanatic, I love nothing more than checking into a property I'm really excited about and exploring it to the fullest during my stay. I'm keenly interested in how hotel teams curate local experiences for guests, and so many of those efforts come through dining — from the design of bar and restaurant spaces to the inclusion of regional ingredients on menus.
With the daily credit, I can explore more options rather than repeatedly visiting the breakfast buffet. On a three-night trip to the Conrad Los Angeles last January, my husband and I used one day's credit on happy hour snacks at the patio fire pits, another on poolside cocktails and a third on lunch at the rooftop restaurant. I came away from that stay feeling like we'd really gotten the most out of our time at the hotel (and, by the way, I'd highly recommend it).
Of course, hotel dining outlets often carry high prices, especially at higher-end resorts where travelers like to use points. So yes, we do sometimes go over the food-and-beverage credit threshold — but that's where the Hilton Honors American Express Surpass® Card comes in handy. The card comes with quarterly $50 statement credits for purchases made directly with properties in the Hilton portfolio, so even if our stay is covered with points, we can offset other on-property purchases with this benefit.
My husband and I both have a Surpass Card, so when we exceed the daily credit limit, we're often reimbursed.

Of course, like most people, I travel for various reasons, many of which are not vacation. For every property I visit that imbues its menu with a sense of place, there's a seriously unglamorous one with food I have absolutely no desire to sample — especially if it's a run-of-the-mill buffet.
I believe these hotels are where the food-and-beverage credit shines.
Many of them feature a grab-and-go marketplace where you can spend your credit on prepackaged meals, snacks or drinks. In addition to being so much more convenient (ever tried to save something from a breakfast buffet for later by wrapping it in napkins, only to get it all over your stuff and ultimately dump it in the trash in frustration?), these outlets often include familiar brand names or even items from local merchants. This can be much more appealing than an overpriced buffet with precooked dishes that have been under heat lamps for hours.
Related: Know your benefits: Hiltons can't opt out of the food-and-beverage credit for elite members
With hotels only offering breakfast during set morning hours, the food-and-beverage credit's flexibility makes it a lot more usable. I often leave a hotel early to catch a flight or set off on a long day of driving for a road trip, completely missing breakfast hours. Other times, I'm working remotely and my schedule doesn't allow me to pop down to the hotel restaurant in the morning. And when traveling from the West Coast to the East Coast, jet lag can also influence how early I'm ready to mobilize.
But thanks to the credits, I can still use my elite benefits in a way that works for my schedule.
For example, last summer, I arrived at the Hilton London Heathrow Airport at 2 a.m. after a series of mishaps that resulted in a truly heinous travel evening. With an early flight requiring a 5 a.m. departure, I was more than happy to use the food-and-beverage credit for middle-of-the-night emotional support french fries instead of airport hotel breakfast.
Hilton Honors' food-and-beverage credits are convenient, flexible and easy to use, making them a great perk of the hotel chain's elite status. Whether you're committed to breakfast, love a lobby bar moment or want to stock up on snacks for later, the credit covers options to suit your needs.
In my opinion, the breakfast changes have made Hilton Gold and Diamond status even more valuable, especially since they're attainable on multiple cards. Cardholders of the Hilton Surpass Card, the Hilton Honors American Express Business Card and The Platinum Card® from American Express (enrollment is required) enjoy complimentary Gold status as long as the card remains open. Meanwhile, you receive automatic Diamond status through the Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card.

The club lounges at many U.S. hotels can be hit or miss. Some hotels are not investing in lounges like they once did, and many have closed their lounges altogether.
Lounge access is one of the most publicized perks for top-tier elite members of hotel loyalty programs, such as World of Hyatt Globalists and Hilton Honors Diamonds, yet it often feels like an afterthought at domestic hotels. That's not true at many hotels overseas, though.
While it might not always be the most useful benefit of holding hotel elite status when traveling in the U.S., lounge access in other regions, including Asia, can transform a hotel stay from humdrum to extraordinary. In fact, it's my favorite elite status perk when traveling internationally.
I recently took a multiweek trip through several countries in Asia, and my status unlocked some fabulous lounges ... and all the free food, drinks and useful workspaces that access opened up. Here's a look at a handful of the lounges I experienced during my travels and why lounge access remains my favorite hotel perk.
Most hotel lounges offer a (usually quiet) sanctuary where you'll find free or almost free drinks and food. Some lounges serve a full buffet breakfast or even made-to-order dishes like omelets. Some also offer light bites throughout the day or even a buffet for dinner. Often, both nonalcoholic and alcoholic drinks are free, though some lounges charge for top-shelf spirits, and tips are generally expected.
Some of the other perks of hotel lounge access may include:
Some lounges even offer garment-pressing or shoeshine services. You'll usually find plenty of comfortable seating options. Some hotel lounges have terraces, often on higher floors with good views.
One of the coolest features of some international hotel lounges is the ability to check in or out with dedicated reception areas as well as more robust concierge services. Sometimes, you'll be escorted to the lounge from the lobby — talk about a VIP experience.

This was the best lounge I experienced on my trip, somewhat to my surprise. The incredible executive lounge at the Conrad Seoul in South Korea is on the top floor of a skyscraper and has sweeping views of the city's futuristic skyline and the Han River. When I booked my stay, I did not even know that the hotel had a lounge, let alone this spectacular space.
The dramatically lit walls held shelves of art, and there were plenty of places to sit for a meal or work session. There was even a flickering fireplace.
I had access thanks to my top-tier Hilton Honors Diamond status, which I have as a result of having the Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card in my wallet.
The information for the Hilton Amex Aspire card has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.
Hilton Honors Diamonds and those who reserve accommodations with club lounge access included in their stay can take advantage of this benefit.
It should be noted that some programs award lounge access even to mid-tier elite members. Marriott Bonvoy members, for example, with Platinum Elite, Titanium Elite or Ambassador Elite status get lounge access at certain properties.
You tend to find lounges at hotels in Hilton's premium portfolio, such as Conrads, Waldorf Astoria properties and full-service Hiltons.
This particular lounge had a full breakfast spread, and there were snacks out at lunch and a full buffet at dinner. There was always something delicious to eat or drink at all hours of the day. Breakfast standouts included pancakes and pastries like croissants, fresh fruit (the sweet grapefruit was delicious) and noodles. There were also an impressive selection of cheeses, along with cold cuts, fresh greens and cereals.
You could literally eat here for every meal during your entire stay for free. That can lead to some serious savings on a trip like mine, though I was also eager to get out and experience the city's fantastic food scene. Still, knowing I could pop in anytime for a snack was a helpful benefit during a hectic stay. The best part of my visits was taking in the sunset after a cold day of sightseeing around Seoul.
One less tangible benefit of having lounge access is that the staff can be super helpful with making arrangements around the hotel or out in the city via concierge services. They are also on hand to help with business needs like getting things printed.
At the Conrad Seoul, the friendly staff was eager to help with any questions visitors had. Interacting with staff members is also a great way to get a local's insight into a destination, I have found, and this stay was no exception.

World of Hyatt really steps up its lounge game outside the U.S. Though I have had a few good experiences in U.S. Hyatt lounges, none holds a candle to what I have found on offer in Asia.
You'll need top-tier World of Hyatt Globalist status for free lounge access, but you could also reserve a room type with club lounge access. Hyatt members can also select two club lounge access awards as Hyatt Milestone Rewards when they reach the qualifying thresholds starting at 20 nights in a status year.
The Grand Club at the Grand Hyatt in Taipei, Taiwan, is one of my favorite lounges. It had attentive service and a variety of lovely seating areas. It felt like a glamorous setting with fresh flowers set out at the entrance along with a selection of international newspapers. There was a check-in desk as well where guests could request hotel services. Servers circulated often to make sure guests had what they needed.
Check out the incredible views of the famous Taipei 101 tower from the lounge (don't mind the dirty windows).
There was a full breakfast spread in the mornings that included an omelet station where eggs could be cooked to order and plenty of both Western and Asian entree options.
While I was there, the hotel was offering guests fresh chocolate or strawberry croissants.
Club access saved me a ton of money in Taipei and kept me fueled with caffeine at all hours of the day and night. The lounge was open most of the day and well into the evening, with a full breakfast spread and then snacks available all day after that. In the evening, there were light bites and desserts laid out that could easily have replaced a full dinner. My favorite feature was the ability to grab an espresso or a soda at any time of the day. Fresh juice and still and sparkling waters were also available throughout the day.
The lounge at the Hyatt Regency Naha, Okinawa occupies much of the 18th floor of the building it occupies in the island's biggest city.
It offered extensive views of the skyline, and guests with access could head straight there to check in or out for their stay. Various rooms were available to relax or eat in. Part of the lounge was closed during certain times of the day, but additional spaces were open during the busy breakfast hours. A grand piano was stationed in one of the massive rooms, though it wasn't being played during my stay.
In the morning, there was a full breakfast with hot and cold buffets set up along one wall. A chef prepared eggs any style at an omelet station in the back of the lounge.
In the evenings, the hotel served light snacks and wine, sparkling wine and cocktails. I say light snacks, but there was a full buffet that many people appeared to enjoy in place of dinner.
I visited for several meals, plus unlimited espressos, during my stay. It added up to serious savings.
The Hyatt Regency Tokyo is famous for its Regency Club lounge, which Hyatt loyalists have raved about for years. During my stay, it was in a temporary space because the hotel was undergoing some major renovations, but it still had plenty of tables and great views of Tokyo.
There was a nice selection of food and drinks, including Nespresso machine-made cappuccinos, fresh juice, Japanese snacks and cookies, to keep me satisfied. The dinner spread had been pretty picked over when I visited later in the evening, but the breakfast options were impressive. Choices included everything from fresh pastries, cold cuts, yogurt and ripe fruit galore to an omelet station and various Western breakfast meats.
I cannot wait to see the renovated club on my next trip to Tokyo. It's expected to be completed in June of this year.
Lounge access can save you hundreds of dollars in food-and-beverage costs, even on short stays. In fact, it's such a great way to save money on trips and enhance your stay, especially when traveling outside the U.S., that it's one of several reasons why I pursue top-tier hotel elite status each year.
