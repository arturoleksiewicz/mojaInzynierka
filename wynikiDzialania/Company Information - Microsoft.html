Microsoft was originally founded on April 4th, 1975, and the tech giant is now celebrating its 50-year anniversary. Microsoft started with a focus on personal computers, building the very software that helped it achieve an early goal of a PC on every desk and in every home.
The success of Windows and Office has allowed Microsoft to launch devices like the Xbox and Surface line and transform its business into software and services in the cloud. Now, Microsoft looks ahead to its next 50 years in a period of AI that could transform everything it does.
Follow along for our coverage of Microsoft’s 50 years, the company’s celebrations, and what’s next for one of the world’s most valuable tech companies.

Microsoft has fired one of the employees who disrupted the company’s 50th-anniversary event. In an email seen by The Verge, Microsoft told Ibtihal Aboussad that their employment has been terminated due to “acts of misconduct.”
Aboussad was one of two protesters that interrupted Microsoft’s 50th anniversary event on Friday by calling Microsoft’s AI CEO, Mustafa Suleyman, a “war profiteer” and demanding that Microsoft “stop using AI for genocide in our region.” A second protester, Vaniya Agrawal, interrupted Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, former CEO Steve Ballmer, and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella later on in the event. Both Microsoft employees also sent separate emails to thousands of coworkers, calling on Microsoft to cut its contracts with the Israeli government.

Microsoft held a special 50th anniversary event at its headquarters earlier today. During Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman’s presentation, a Microsoft employee interrupted the event to protest the use of Microsoft’s technologies in Israel’s war against Hamas. A second employee interrupted the event later on, while CEO Satya Nadella, co-founder Bill Gates, and former CEO Steve Ballmer were discussing 50 years of Microsoft.

This is a laptop you might want to buy, but you won’t be able to. Microsoft has created a limited edition 50th anniversary version of its Surface Laptop 7. It has the retro 1975 Microsoft logo etched into the palm rest area, a golden accent color on the Surface logo, and there’s even a golden Windows 11 wallpaper. Microsoft is giving away 50 of these special edition laptops in competitions to mark its 50-year milestone.

Microsoft’s 50th anniversary event has been overshadowed by two employee protestors, but that didn’t stop former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer from doing his famous developers, developers, developers chant.

A Microsoft employee disrupted the company’s 50th anniversary event to protest its use of AI.
“Shame on you,” said Microsoft employee Ibtihal Aboussad, speaking directly to Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman. “You are a war profiteer. Stop using AI for genocide. Stop using AI for genocide in our region. You have blood on your hands. All of Microsoft has blood on its hands. How dare you all celebrate when Microsoft is killing children. Shame on you all.”

Fifty years ago today, Micro-Soft was founded by friends Bill Gates and Paul Allen. As the name implies, Microsoft was originally focused on microprocessors and software, and Gates and Allen created the company to develop software for the Altair 8800, an early personal computer.
Founded on April 4th, 1975, Microsoft went on to strike a deal with IBM to provide software for its first PC in 1980. This became the foundation of MS-DOS, which dominated IBM-compatible PCs during the ’80s. Microsoft’s early success in developing software for PCs eventually led to the first version of Windows in 1985 and a dream of a PC on every desk and in every home.

It’s pretty rare to see Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, former CEO Steve Ballmer, and CEO Satya Nadella together, but the company’s 50-year anniversary has united the trio. Microsoft has used the opportunity to get Copilot to interview all three and roast them. The full conversation is available in the Copilot app.

Microsoft turns 50 on Friday April 4th, and its celebrating early with a new Xbox Dynamic Background, some nostalgic wallpapers, and a 50th anniversary theme for Solitaire. You can grab the wallpapers from here, apply the Dynamic Background on Xbox Series S / X console, grab an Xbox profile badge from the Xbox Insider Hub, and apply the 50th anniversary theme directly in Solitaire. Microsoft is also holding a special event on Friday to announce some new additions to Copilot.

This week, on April 4th, Microsoft turns 50 years old. The company has gone through sweeping changes over that time — from two guys in New Mexico to more than a quarter-million employees worldwide, from making text-based operating systems to holographic video games — but through the decades, it’s remained a foundation of the tech world.
Microsoft has made a lot of products over its 50 years, ranging from file formats and PC accessories to cloud servers and design languages. A great many were duds — it’s hard to nail everything over five decades — but a lot were memorable, fascinating, or simply excellent products that would go on to be used by billions of people or change the industry in their wake.

Microsoft has started sending out invites to a 50th anniversary and Copilot event at the company’s headquarters in Redmond, Washington. The April 4th event will take place on the day Microsoft marks 50 years since it was first founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975.
The event on Microsoft’s campus will include an employee-only celebration of the company’s 50 years, alongside details on what’s next for the consumer side of Microsoft’s Copilot AI companion. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman, and other “leaders of past and present” will be part of the Copilot and 50th anniversary event.

Microsoft is rolling out a new sign-in screen for more than a billion consumers that access services like Outlook, Windows, Xbox, Microsoft 365, and more. The updated authentication screen is based on Microsoft’s Fluent 2 design language and even includes a dark mode with Xbox colors.
The entire authentication process for Microsoft accounts has been improved as part of this redesign, with a bigger emphasis on passwordless authentication. “Our new UX is optimized for a passwordless and passkey-first experience,” says Robin Goldstein, partner director of product management for Microsoft Identity. “We’ve reduced the number of concepts per screen to lower cognitive load and speed up the authentication process, plus re-ordered some steps to logically flow better.”
The more simplified design also includes light and dark themes, which are enabled automatically based on your device configuration. “The first place to see this will be on Gaming apps,” says Goldstein. “Other consumer apps will support Dark Mode in the future.”
Xbox users will already start to see this new sign-in experience across the web and on mobile, and the full updates to the authentication screen will roll out throughout March and April. Web and mobile apps will get the new user experience first, followed by Windows apps.
This new design is limited to consumer profiles, so there will be no changes to Microsoft Entra work and school accounts. “However, the learnings from these improvements give my team valuable insights for updating the default Microsoft Entra and Microsoft Entra External ID account experiences in the future, including the common sign-in screen for apps that support authentication via both Microsoft accounts and Microsoft Entra accounts,” says Goldstein.
This new sign-in UI is probably related to Microsoft’s plans to automatically keep you signed into to an account. The software giant sent notifications to Outlook.com users about a potential account change in February, but Microsoft then revealed this was a mistake and edited a Microsoft support article referencing keeping accounts signed in automatically unless you sign out or use private browsing. We’re still waiting to hear when these additional sign-in changes will roll out.

Microsoft has reportedly revealed some new 3D Office icons in an email survey.
by  Tom Warren
Microsoft appears to be working on new 3D icons for its Office suite. Reddit users have discovered the new icons in an email survey from Microsoft, reports Windows Central. The survey includes a brief look at the new icons, with Microsoft asking for feedback on its changes to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and other Office apps.
The new Microsoft 365 app icons have a more 3D look and feel to them, and follow a similar design language to the 3D emoji that Microsoft added to Windows 11 in 2023. Microsoft also recently overhauled its sign-in UI with a new design and dark mode, as part of the company’s Fluent 2 design language.
Microsoft hasn’t redesigned its Office app icons since 2018, when it launched a modern look for apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. The previous design overhaul included a more simplified ribbon interface in its Office apps, and the original Fluent design system integrated into Office apps.
Microsoft hasn’t officially unveiled these new Office icons yet, and the company might just be looking for feedback before it tweaks them and releases something different. We’ve asked Microsoft to comment on the Office app icons, but the company didn’t respond in time for publication.

Microsoft is holding a 50th Anniversary Copilot livestream today at 12:30PM ET / 9:30AM PT on April 4th, the same day Microsoft founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen started the company in 1975. Dubbed “Introducing your AI companion,” it’s set up for Microsoft to show off some significant updates to its Windows AI assistant.
You can watch the livestream right here via the YouTube stream or directly from Microsoft.
Microsoft announced the event last month, which features Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman, and “leaders of past and present.”
Microsoft recently announced deep research and other “agentic” updates to Copilot in Microsoft 365, and a more significant reboot could help it keep up with tools released for competing AI platforms like ChatGPT and Gemini. CEO Satya Nadella recently commented on the success of DeepSeek’s AI, saying to employees that “What’s most impressive about DeepSeek is that it’s a great reminder of what 200 people can do when they come together with one thought and one play… not just leaving it there as a research project or an open source project, but to turn it into a product that was number one in the App Store. That’s the new bar to me.”
Follow along below for all of the updates from Microsoft’s 50th Anniversary Copilot event.

Microsoft is bringing its Copilot Vision feature to Windows and mobile, moving it beyond the web. Copilot Vision was a big part of Microsoft’s Copilot redesign last year, but so far, it has been limited to Edge webpages to help guide you through what you’re seeing.
Copilot Vision will now be able to analyze real-time video from a mobile camera, allowing the AI assistant to offer tips for keeping plants healthy or decorating advice for your home. Microsoft is launching Copilot Vision inside the Copilot app for iOS and Android today, and a similar feature is also coming to Windows soon.

In the second major disruption of today’s 50th anniversary event at Microsoft’s headquarters, another employee stood up and began yelling at Satya Nadella, Steve Ballmer, and Bill Gates — the company’s current and past CEOs — in protest of Microsoft’s dealings with the government of Israel.
“Shame on you all. You’re all hypocrites,” said Microsoft employee Vaniya Agrawal, as some in the crowd began to boo. “50,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been murdered with Microsoft technology. How dare you. Shame on all of you for celebrating on their blood. Cut ties with Israel.” The protestor then mentioned No Azure for Apartheid, the group that coordinated today’s protests both inside and outside the venue. It’s been a long-running movement among some employees at the company.

Microsoft is making changes to Copilot that will allow the artificial intelligence assistant to complete online tasks for you. Using “simple chat prompts,” these “Actions” can be performed in the background while you work on other tasks, according to Microsoft, and can do things like book restaurant reservations, event tickets, and purchase items to ship to your friends.
Launch partners include Booking.com, Expedia, Kayak, Tripadvisor, Skyscanner, Viator, Vrbo, and Priceline — a host of travel and vacation-focused services that will allow Copilot to help users plan any upcoming trips — alongside Open Table for meals, and 1-800-Flowers.com for buying floral arrangements. Microsoft says that Copilot’s Actions feature will “work with most websites across the web,” and can sort out “the ride home” for you after events, suggesting it will also support taxi or ride-sharing services.
Dominic Preston
As it marks its 50th anniversary, Microsoft is updating Copilot with a host of new features all at once that bring it more in line with alternatives like ChatGPT or Claude. The AI assistant, which uses many OpenAI models, now supports memory, personalization, web-based actions, podcast creation, camera and screen analysis, deep research, and even more.
With Memory, Copilot will now be able to keep track of your preferences, interests, and details like your birthday, and use the information to tailor responses and advice or make proactive suggestions. Microsoft says that users can choose what information they want Copilot to remember, or opt out entirely.

Microsoft is making its AI features widely available on Copilot Plus PCs equipped with Intel and AMD chips. One of the most notable of these features will be Live Captions, which translates audio to English subtitles from dozens of different languages in real time.
Microsoft first started testing Live Captions on Intel and AMD devices last December, and it’s now available through the latest Windows 11 update. The update also includes Cocreator, an AI tool in Paint that creates an image based on a text description and what you’re currently drawing. On top of that, Microsoft is also expanding access to its AI image editor and generator in the Photos app.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella moved quickly to get DeepSeek’s R1 deployed on Azure in January. Nadella appeared to have anticipated the rise of a breakthrough like R1, and now he says a new bar has been set for the company’s own AI work.
Speaking at an employee-only town hall last month, Nadella and his senior leadership team discussed DeepSeek and the company’s own $80 billion investment into AI at length, answering questions from employees about the giant spend and its effect on Microsoft’s carbon-free goals, sources at the company tell me.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is moving the company’s HR chief, Kathleen Hogan, into a new role focused on corporate strategy. Announced in an internal memo to Microsoft employees this morning, Hogan will report directly to Nadella and be responsible for strategy and transformation.
Hogan has been at Microsoft for more than 20 years and spent the past decade as the company’s chief people officer. She helped usher in a new work culture at Microsoft and took on the head of HR role shortly after Nadella became CEO in 2014. Now, Hogan has to steer strategy through the rapid changes of Microsoft’s AI era.

Microsoft is finally rolling out a native version of its Copilot Windows app, nearly a year after turning it into a basic web app. A new Copilot app is rolling out to Windows Insiders this week that’s built using native XAML and includes a new side panel and an improved UI.
The Copilot app on Windows now matches the design of the recently launched Copilot app for macOS, which lets you upload images and generate images or text. You can also interact with Copilot using a microphone, and access conversation history in the updated sidebar.

Microsoft is starting to test its new Copilot Vision feature today. Originally unveiled in October, Copilot Vision allows Microsoft’s AI companion to see what you see on an Edge webpage you’re browsing. You can then ask it questions about the text, images, and content you’re viewing or use it to assist you.
“When you choose to enable Copilot Vision, it sees the page you’re on, it reads along with you, and you can talk through the problem you’re facing together,” says the Copilot team in a blog post. “Browsing no longer needs to be a lonely experience with just you and all your tabs.”

The model built by Bill Gates and Paul Allen remains decades later. What’s changed is how Microsoft responds to a flop.

In 2005, Microsoft’s leaders were starting to get worried. Windows and Office were doing well, but the company’s lead software architect, Ray Ozzie, warned them that an emerging trend threatened Microsoft’s very existence.
“A new business model has emerged in the form of advertising-supported services and software,” warned Ozzie in his famous memo. “This model has the potential to fundamentally impact how we and other developers build, deliver, and monetize innovations.”
Ozzie wanted Microsoft to get ready for the web-based world and cloud computing, fearing the company would otherwise be left behind. In the years after Ozzie’s memo, Google started to build an online competitor to Office with its Google Docs web service that it was selling to businesses and offering free to consumers. But the idea of moving Office to the cloud remained controversial internally. Doing so would upend Microsoft’s traditional method of selling software — and potentially eat into short-term profits in a big way.
“It was a gutsy call, it wasn’t a popular call at Microsoft at that time,” says Rajesh Jha, executive vice president of Microsoft’s experiences and devices group. Steve Ballmer, then Microsoft’s CEO, decided to go ahead with it, moving Office to the cloud and launching Azure fully in 2010.
Office 365 launched initially in beta, and Microsoft faced challenges transforming Office for the web. “The early days of Office 365 were rough,” admits Jha. Microsoft had to perform the painstaking transition of moving apps that were built for a different architecture and era to the cloud and make that scale properly. “I remember Steve [Ballmer] talking to me and saying ‘I’ve got your back, go fix this stuff.”
It was the type of change that Microsoft has navigated time and time again over its 50-year history, an epoch marked by success, pivots, and failures. It’s easy to think Microsoft would be embarrassed by the launch of Windows 8, the performance of the Zune, and its failure in smartphones — surely, the company wishes those things had done better. But earnest attempts at something new are the whole point.
“We’re still around and leading things because we accept change,” says Steven Bathiche, head of Microsoft’s applied sciences group, in an interview with The Verge. “That’s the pearl about Microsoft that’s kind of unique with a company as old as ours, in an industry that changes as rapidly as ours.”
Microsoft turns 50 years old today. The company was founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen as Micro-Soft. A lot has changed since then, but in many ways, the company’s core business model and ethos remain the same: make software that everyone needs and get it installed everywhere.
Gates and Allen began that strategy with Altair BASIC, a BASIC interpreter for the Altair 8800 — a computer made by MITS, rather than one they made themselves. After making an interpreter for one computer, they started bringing it to every other PC maker that would take them. Following the success of Microsoft BASIC, the company would repeat the strategy with MS-DOS, and eventually Windows and Office.
But building those must-use platforms has taken a lot of experimentation, and Microsoft has often had the right idea at the wrong time — and missed out on major markets as a result.
”I’d come in as this mad scientist and show him all this cool stuff we were doing in hardware and software”
Microsoft had SPOT smartwatches decades before the Apple Watch and Windows XP-powered tablet PCs years before the iPad. One of the company’s biggest misses was mobile. Microsoft has experimented with so much hardware and software over the years that it should have been in the ideal position to be the primary alternative to the . Instead, its platform burned out, and the company wasted billions on the acquisition of Nokia in a fruitless attempt to catch up.
Still, Microsoft insiders say it’s these experiments that have teed up many of the company’s eventual successes.
“We used to do these invention sessions with Bill [Gates] which was a lot of fun,” says Bathiche. “I was pretty young when Bill was around so I’d come in as this mad scientist and show him all this cool stuff we were doing in hardware and software, and I think he really appreciated that.”
Some of those experiments would unlock touch computing and cloud advances, helping pave the way for Microsoft’s own laptops and tablets. Other hardware and software experiments led to the Xbox, Microsoft’s best example of combining software and hardware into a successful consumer product. At its heart, Xbox is about enabling developers to build compelling games with software, and it was originally dubbed a “Windows entertainment project” and developed by members of Microsoft’s DirectX team to fend off the threat of Sony’s PS2 console in the living room.
Other Microsoft projects have taken a more roundabout route to becoming successful products. One major case that Bathiche mentions is Cortana, the voice assistant first designed for its phone platform. The assistant didn’t catch on as an alternative to Siri and Alexa and was eventually shut down.
“The Cortana days, that was really difficult,” admits Bathiche. The project required Microsoft to develop technologies around local compute and to optimize for Arm chips. “So that project, even though I kind of failed on enabling that sort of solution, I took all those technologies that we developed as a team and applied them to Windows and Surface.”
Those technologies, from optimizing Cortana to getting Windows Phone to run on Arm chips, helped with Microsoft’s work with the Surface Pro X and the early AI-powered experiences in Windows. “That’s going to set us up for the next decade,” says Bathiche.
That history speaks to why Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has been so aggressive when it comes to AI.
One of Microsoft’s most significant deals under Nadella has been its partnership with OpenAI. Microsoft originally invested $1 billion into OpenAI in 2019 to become the exclusive provider of cloud computing services to the AI research lab. It then extended that partnership in 2023 with an additional $10 billion investment, just months after ChatGPT launched and became the fastest-growing app in history. 
This investment has fueled Microsoft’s ongoing AI transformation, amid fears that Google was years ahead of it in scaling up AI efforts. For Bathiche, this new AI era illustrates patterns that allow companies like Microsoft to take advantage of the constant change in compute ability and build new experiences or new device form factors.
“When we had the first computers they would load a very specific program and that’s the only thing they could do,” says Bathiche. Microsoft saw the opportunity early on to build Windows as a way for developers to talk to PC hardware easily and create apps with a GUI on top. Then the internet was a layer on top of that, which changed how software could be delivered.
“The race is on to compile that piece of code uniquely, individually, for every person on the planet.”
“Now we’re on the next layer, which is the agent layer,” says Bathiche, describing intelligent software that acts autonomously on behalf of a user. “That’s the exciting one we’re trying to figure out.” Microsoft has always developed software by compiling an app like Word, and then everyone gets that same piece of software, whether it was delivered via a CD-ROM or over the internet. Microsoft is now trying to build software that adapts on the fly.
“The race is on to compile that piece of code uniquely, individually, for every person on the planet. The reason is that these AI agent experiences we’re talking about are really about deep personalization and understanding and customization,” says Bathiche. 
This push toward unique and personalized software through AI has driven compute needs like never before, and Microsoft’s Azure AI teams are constantly having to adapt to new models or new hardware that unlocks even more AI capabilities. We saw that recently with Microsoft’s quick adoption of DeepSeek’s R1 model into its Azure AI Foundry.
“All of the systems that we’ve built for 50 years need to apply to AI agents,” says Asha Sharma, corporate vice president of Microsoft’s AI platform. “For Azure AI Foundry we’re thinking about how we evolve to become the operating system on the backend of every single agent.”
Microsoft envisions a world where AI agents will work alongside you as digital colleagues and collaborators. “I think a lot of the systems we’ve built for 50 years will be critical infrastructure for the digital workforce,” says Sharma. “We need to think about having not just human understandable interfaces, but machine understandable interfaces.”
“You go do fundamental research, you bring out a model, and then translate it into a real breakthrough feature”
Part of winning this AI battle will be down to Microsoft’s own models, and using competitor models wisely. Microsoft unveiled its own Muse AI model recently, which has been trained on the Xbox game Bleeding Edge to generate gameplay. Nadella stressed the importance of Microsoft’s own AI work during a recent employee town hall meeting, saying, “When I think about what we’re trying to do with Muse, that’s the bar. You go do fundamental research, you bring out a model, and then translate it into a real breakthrough feature in Copilot.”
Beyond digital colleagues and Xbox changes, Microsoft is also hinting at fundamental ways AI could live in the physical world. “I believe that some of our AI agents in the future will be embodied agents that are able to make plans and take actions on behalf of users in physical environments,” says Ashley Llorens, corporate vice president and managing director of Microsoft Research. “Not just the same very carefully engineered environments that we have many robots in today, but in many of the semi-structured environments that people live and work in. One of the challenges there is teaching AI how to reason over the relationships between objects and environments in time and space.”
AI-powered robots might sound like science fiction right now, but Microsoft is increasingly focused on robotics, healthcare, and even quantum computing, so anything seems possible for its next 50 years. Since Microsoft’s mobile miss, I’ve always gotten the feeling that the company is wary about missing the next big thing, so I’m fully expecting it to pivot if the AI era slows down.
Microsoft’s resilience and its ability to predict what’s next — like Gates in the early days of Microsoft or Ozzie in 2005 — have defined the company’s existence over the past 50 years. Moments of potential demise have forced Microsoft to make big bets that weren’t always successful but did lead to change.
Now, Microsoft has gone all in on AI. Its efforts might even contribute to the “singularity,” a point in time when artificial intelligence exceeds the abilities of humans and, perhaps, even our control. What that will look like is anyone’s guess. But if the AI hype bubble bursts and it’s more a Windows Mobile flop than an Azure hit, I’m sure of one thing: Microsoft will adapt to meet the challenge.

Microsoft’s software empire started all the way back in 1975 with Altair BASIC.

Fifty years ago today, Micro-Soft was founded by friends Bill Gates and Paul Allen. As the name implies, Microsoft was originally focused on microprocessors and software, and Gates and Allen created the company to develop software for the Altair 8800, an early personal computer.
Founded on April 4th, 1975, Microsoft went on to strike a deal with IBM to provide software for its first PC in 1980. This became the foundation of MS-DOS, which dominated IBM-compatible PCs during the ’80s. Microsoft’s early success in developing software for PCs eventually led to the first version of Windows in 1985 and a dream of a PC on every desk and in every home.
That early Windows GUI on top of MS-DOS quickly progressed into an even more capable operating system with the launch of Windows 95. The highly-anticipated version of Windows launched at midnight, with fans lining up at stores to get boxed copies of Windows 95 to install on their PCs. Windows 95 introduced many parts of Windows that we still use today, including the familiar desktop, File Explorer, My Documents area, and Recycle Bin.
While Microsoft was improving Windows with every release, it was also developing a variety of productivity apps throughout the 1980s that would soon become the company’s Office suite. Launched originally in 1989 for the Mac, Office quickly became an important productivity suite on Windows that even runs inside a web browser these days. Office and Windows are now used by billions of people every day, making Microsoft one of the most valuable tech companies in the world.
Microsoft’s success with Windows and Office has allowed the company to expand in many directions over the past 50 years, including the launch of the Xbox game console in 2001, the Azure cloud push in 2008, and even the Bing search engine launch in 2009.
Microsoft has also experimented with a variety of hardware over the years, but its most successful device lineup has come in the form of Surface, which originally launched in 2012 alongside Windows 8. Surface has served as a vehicle to demonstrate the best of Windows and Office, and it’s quickly becoming a test bed for Microsoft’s AI ambitions on the PC.
Microsoft’s next 50 years look increasingly focused on an AI transformation it’s in the middle of building toward. It has the potential to overhaul Windows, Office, Azure, and practically every business that Microsoft has built over the decades.
Microsoft is celebrating its 50-year anniversary today during a special event at the company’s headquarters in Redmond, Washington. The software maker will unveil new Copilot features, and we’re expecting to see familiar faces from the past and present of Microsoft to reflect on the company’s 50 years and the future of this tech giant.

Microsoft has six new security agents that can do things like process phishing and data loss alerts.
by  Tom Warren
Microsoft launched its AI-powered Security Copilot a year ago to bring a chatbot to the cybersecurity space, and now it’s expanding it with AI agents that are designed to autonomously assist overwhelmed security teams. Microsoft is unveiling six of its own AI agents for its Security Copilot, as well as five that have been created by its partners.
Microsoft’s six security agents will be available in preview next month, and are designed to do things like triage and process phishing and data loss alerts, prioritize critical incidents, and monitor for vulnerabilities. “The six Microsoft Security Copilot agents enable teams to autonomously handle high-volume security and IT tasks while seamlessly integrating with Microsoft Security solutions,“ says Vasu Jakkal, corporate vice president of Microsoft Security.
Microsoft is also working with OneTrust, Aviatrix, BlueVoyant, Tanium, and Fletch to enable some third-party security agents. These extensions will make it easier to analyze data breaches with OneTrust or perform root cause analysis of network outages and failures with Aviatrix.
AI agents are becoming an increasingly popular way for companies like Microsoft to sell businesses on AI tools. Microsoft relaunched its Copilot for businesses earlier this year with free AI chat and access to pay-as-you-go AI agents.
While these latest AI agents in the Security Copilot are designed for security teams to take advantage of, Microsoft is also improving its phishing protection in Microsoft Teams. Microsoft Defender for Office 365 will start protecting Teams users against phishing and other cyberthreats within Teams next month, including better protection against malicious URLs and attachments.
Microsoft also has a lot of other industry-specific security announcements today and at its upcoming Microsoft Secure event on April 9th. You can read more about them over at Microsoft’s security blog.

Multi-step reasoning AI is coming to Microsoft Copilot.
by  Richard Lawler
After Google and OpenAI offered up AI news on Tuesday, Microsoft has followed with announcements of its own, including details of two “deep reasoning” agents for Microsoft 365 Copilot that it claims are the first of their kind, dubbed Researcher and Analyst, as well as new capabilities for custom AI agents. Researcher relies on OpenAI’s deep research AI model to pull off “complex, multi-step research,” along with access to third-party data via connectors to sources like Salesforce or ServiceNow so that business customers can derive insights from across their tools.
Analyst is based on the o3-mini reasoning model from OpenAI, and Microsoft claims that with chain-of-thought reasoning, it’s capable of turning raw data into spreadsheets, running Python code that you can view while it’s running, and operate on the level of a skilled data scientist, pulling together reports like this one (pdf).
Those tools are scheduled to start rolling out in April to Microsoft 365 Copilot license holders in an early access program, along with new autonomous agent capabilities that are starting to roll out now in Copilot Studio.
Microsoft claims the new agent flows in Copilot are powerful enough to “automate any task you can imagine” with rule-based workflows that include AI actions. The LinkedIn announcement describes situations like an agent flow that directs feedback emails to the correct team, but we’ll have to see it in action to find out how that’s better than adding a checkbox or two, or how well its “low code” experience really works, and if it can deliver on the promises AI companies are making about agents.

Now all Copilot Plus PCs can generate Live Captions.
by  Emma Roth
Microsoft is making its AI features widely available on Copilot Plus PCs equipped with Intel and AMD chips. One of the most notable of these features will be Live Captions, which translates audio to English subtitles from dozens of different languages in real time.
Microsoft first started testing Live Captions on Intel and AMD devices last December, and it’s now available through the latest Windows 11 update. The update also includes Cocreator, an AI tool in Paint that creates an image based on a text description and what you’re currently drawing. On top of that, Microsoft is also expanding access to its AI image editor and generator in the Photos app.
These features were previously only available on Copilot Plus PCs with Qualcomm chips. Microsoft started testing Recall, an AI feature that takes screenshots of your activity on a Copilot Plus PC and lets you search through them, with Intel and AMD devices last year, though there’s still no word when it will become widely available.
Additionally, Microsoft is updating Voice Access — an accessibility feature that lets people control their PC with their voice — on Qualcomm-powered Copilot Plus PCs. Microsoft says Voice Access users on these devices will now “be able to communicate with their PCs using more descriptive and flexible language.” It’s also adding the ability to translate 27 languages into Simplified Chinese. Microsoft says it plans to roll out both of these features to Intel and AMD devices in the future.

Five major video game companies, including Nintendo of America and Microsoft, are joining a major new “cross-industry effort” managed by the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) to share clearer information about the accessibility features in their games.
As part of the “Accessible Games Initiative,” the five “founding members” — Electronic Arts, Google, Microsoft, Nintendo of America, and Ubisoft — will initially use a set of 24 tags like “large and clear subtitles” and “narrated menus” to communicate certain accessibility features, according to a press release.
According to the Accessible Games Initiative website, the list of tags includes:
The companies will put the tags on places like their digital storefronts and product pages (which typically already feature information on things like how many players a game supports and age ratings). However, the ESA says the timeline for the implementation of the tags will be “determined on a company-by-company basis and is always voluntary.”
“The timeline for implementation of the tags is company-dependent,” Aubrey Quinn, ESA’s senior vice president for communications, tells The Verge. “While we cannot speak for them about their plans, we know companies are working with the relevant departments across their individual organizations to bring the tags to their consumers.”
The five founding members and Sony Interactive Entertainment “first developed” the initiative. When we asked why Sony isn’t a founding member, Quinn told us to reach out to Sony, which didn’t reply to a request for comment. Amazon Games, Riot Games, Square Enix, and Warner Bros. Games have joined the initiative, too.
The Verge has asked all of the companies involved when they might implement the tags. Here’s what we’ve heard back.
Additionally, an article on Nintendo’s website says that: “Nintendo of America will be introducing these tags in the future.”
Update, March 21st: Added information from Nintendo of America.

                <p class="wikipedia-summary">Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational corporation and technology conglomerate headquartered in Redmond, Washington. Founded in 1975, the company became highly influential in the rise of personal computers through software like Windows, and the company has since expanded to Internet services, cloud computing, video gaming and other fields. Microsoft is the largest software maker, one of the most valuable public U.S. companies, and one of the most valuable brands globally.
Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. During the 41 years from 1980 to 2021 Microsoft released 9 versions of MS-DOS with a median frequency of 2 years, and 13 versions of Windows with a median frequency of 3 years. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO) and subsequent rise in its share price created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market. Steve Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO in 2000.  He oversaw the then-largest of Microsoft's corporate acquisitions in Skype Technologies in 2011, and an increased focus on hardware that led to its first in-house PC line, the Surface, in 2012, and the formation of Microsoft Mobile through Nokia. Since Satya Nadella took over as CEO in 2014, the company has changed focus towards cloud computing, as well as its large acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in 2016. Under Nadella's direction, the company has also expanded its video gaming business to support the Xbox brand, establishing the Microsoft Gaming division in 2022 and acquiring Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in 2023.
Microsoft has been market-dominant in the IBM PC–compatible operating system market and the office software suite market since the 1990s. Its best-known software products are the Windows line of operating systems and the Microsoft Office and Microsoft 365 suite of productivity applications, which most notably include the Word word processor and Excel spreadsheet editor. Its flagship hardware products are the Surface lineup of personal computers and Xbox video game consoles, the latter of which includes the Xbox network; the company also provides a range of consumer Internet services such as Bing web search, the MSN web portal, the Outlook.com (Hotmail) email service and the Microsoft Store. In the enterprise and development fields, Microsoft most notably provides the Azure cloud computing platform, Microsoft SQL Server database software, and Visual Studio.
Microsoft is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Meta. In April 2019, Microsoft reached a trillion-dollar market cap, becoming the third public U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion. It has been criticized for its monopolistic practices, and the company's software has been criticized for problems with ease of use, robustness, and security.</p>
