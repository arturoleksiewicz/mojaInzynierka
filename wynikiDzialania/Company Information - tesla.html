The CEO is absent, the stock is plummeting, and the brand is toxic. Tesla’s future looks grim.

Tesla stock plunged 15 percent on Monday, its steepest drop in five years. The price is down over 50 percent since its December highs. Tesla owners, disgusted with Elon Musk’s slash-and-burn tactics for the Trump administration, are selling their vehicles at a big loss. And Tesla showrooms across the country are becoming magnets for large crowds of protesters who want to see the company fail spectacularly. 
But at least Musk can still count on one guy to have his back. 
“I’m going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American,” President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday. “Why should he be punished for putting his tremendous skills to work in order to help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN???”
But it will probably take more than a Cybertruck in the presidential motorcade to make Tesla great again. It will take an actual commitment to more affordable electric vehicles. It will take a more serious and safer approach to driverless cars. And it may take a change of leadership to get the company back on track. Let’s run down the company’s problems.
Trump’s election last year sent Tesla’s stock price soaring, as investors rewarded Musk for making the right political bet. It hit a record high of $488 in mid-December; by early March, it had sunk to roughly $226. 
The wipeout erased over $800 billion in market value, Tesla’s steepest drop in years. Musk’s own net worth took an over $100 billion hit. (But don’t worry: he’s still the richest man in the world.)
What happened? Setting Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) side quest and the resulting protests aside for a moment, the simplest explanation is that Tesla’s sales suck. The company produced 4 percent fewer cars in 2024 than it did the previous year. And its deliveries were essentially flat. Tesla earnings came in light, even with a Bitcoin boost.
Musk’s own net worth took an over $100 billion hit.
In California, Tesla’s biggest market in the US, its sales dropped almost 8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 12 percent for the year. Coastal elites’ love affair with the brand has soured. 
And it’s not just in the US. In February, Tesla’s sales were down 10 percent in Spain, 42 percent in Sweden, 45 percent in France, 48 percent in Norway and Denmark, 53 percent in Portugal, 55 percent in Italy, and a whopping 76 percent in Germany. Musk’s endorsement may have helped Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party place second in the recent election, but it doesn’t seem to have improved his company’s flagging sales in Europe — down 45 percent in January year over year. 
In China, the world’s largest car market, Tesla is on a sustained losing streak. The company has been backsliding for the past five consecutive months on a year-on-year basis, according to data from the country’s Passenger Car Association. Some of this is likely related to a temporary factory suspension to accommodate the new Model Y Juniper assembly line, but rising competition from domestic automakers like BYD is putting increased pressure on Tesla. 
And unlike BYD, Tesla doesn’t sell any hybrid vehicles. It has nothing to fall back on when consumers feel anxious about the future of electric vehicles.
A frequent criticism you see about Tesla is that the company’s vehicle lineup is getting a little long in the tooth. The Model X turns 10 this year, while the Model S is pushing 15. Both vehicles have only received minor updates since their initial launch. (A Tesla executive promised a refresh later this year.)
The Model 3 and Model Y, which represent the bulk of the company’s automotive revenues, were both updated recently, but the lag in regular updates has opened a window of opportunity for Tesla’s competitors. Consumers interested in plug-in power suddenly have a wealth of choices as newer, more interesting EVs from Hyundai, Kia, Honda, and General Motors hit the market. 
Meanwhile, Tesla’s only new model to be introduced in the last five years is the Cybertruck, which has been recalled seven times since its launch. Musk has said that frequent software updates obviate the need for a more regular cadence of model refreshes. 
While Tesla sales dropped, sales of non-Tesla EVs continued to climb. Americans bought a record 1.3 million electric cars, an increase of 7.3 percent year over year, according to Cox Automotive’s Kelley Blue Book. EVs now claim 8.1 percent of the market in the US. 
Americans aren’t souring on electric vehicles — they’re just over Tesla. 
For years, Musk has been promising to make an affordable electric vehicle, likely priced at $25,000. He first mentioned it in a 2018 interview, saying, “A $25,000 car, that’s something we can do.” Then, in 2020, at the company’s first Battery Day event, he speculated that Tesla could eventually produce upward of 20 million of these vehicles in a year — or roughly twice the current production of Toyota, GM, or Volkswagen.
Musk has said the more affordable EV would be built on the company’s next-generation vehicle platform. But rather than prioritize a vehicle that investors took to calling the “Model 2,” he spent Tesla’s resources on the expensive, polarizing Cybertruck. And after some initial excitement, the truck has turned into a flop. Musk predicted that Tesla would eventually sell 500,000 Cybertrucks a year. Last year, the company only sold an estimated 40,000. 
Americans aren’t souring on electric vehicles — they’re just over Tesla. 
Musk has also actively gummed up the works for a cheaper Tesla vehicle. Last year, he reportedly canceled the company’s plans to build a low-cost electric vehicle in favor of going all in on a robotaxi. But after some pushback, he claimed that a cheaper Tesla was back on the menu — only now, the vehicles are expected to be built on the same platform as the Model 3 and Model Y. Now, investors are worried that this new vehicle will cannibalize Model 3 and Model Y sales rather than boost the company’s profits overall. 
Meanwhile, Kia and Volkswagen have announced plans to actually produce affordable EVs. And China has cracked the code on budget-priced, highly affordable EVs. The BYD Seagull, for example, was the country’s bestselling vehicle last summer, with about 190 miles of range and a sticker price of around $10,000. Even with a 100 percent tariff, the Seagull would still sell for a price much cheaper than most US-made EVs.
Of course, Musk doesn’t think Tesla even needs a $25,000 vehicle. The company’s future is in AI — specifically self-driving cars and humanoid robots. In October 2024, he undercut his company’s own guidance to make “affordable models” by commenting, “I think having a regular $25,000 model is pointless. It would be silly. It would be completely at odds with what we believe.”
Musk now believes that Tesla is on the verge of solving autonomy. He’s claimed that fully autonomous vehicles are right around the corner for almost a decade now. “Optimus has the potential to be north of $10 trillion in revenue,” he said during the most recent earnings call, referring to Tesla’s humanoid robots. 
“I think having a regular $25,000 model is pointless.”
But while Musk bloviates about robots, Waymo and others are operating real driverless cars on the road. The Alphabet-owned company just launched its first partnership with Uber in Austin, Texas — Tesla’s headquarters and the city where Musk has said he plans on launching his own robotaxi project this summer. 
There’s little evidence that Tesla is on the cusp of delivering what Waymo has already done. The promise that all Tesla vehicles built after 2016 have the hardware necessary for full self-driving turned out to be totally false. Musk said the company would replace the onboard computers for vehicle owners who bought the FSD package, a process he admitted would be “painful.” Tesla has already been targeted with a class action lawsuit claiming the company lied about the capabilities of its vehicles. 
And then there’s Elon. And DOGE. And the fascist salute. And the chainsaw. And everything else going on behind those dark sunglasses. 
Musk’s antics have turned the Tesla brand toxic. Disillusioned owners are selling their vehicles at big losses. Others are swapping in badges from other vehicle brands or using desperate-sounding stickers to signal their dissatisfaction with the billionaire CEO. 
And even more are protesting outside Tesla showrooms as part of a grassroots effort to oppose Musk’s takeover of the federal government, damage the company’s stock price, and maybe even slash the world’s richest man’s net worth. 
Separately, there have been a growing number of reports of arson and vandalism at the company’s stores. Tesla charging stations have been set on fire. A showroom in Oregon was shot up. A woman was arrested in Colorado for throwing a Molotov cocktail at a Tesla location. Tesla vehicles have been defaced with swastikas and expletives. Four Cybertrucks were destroyed in a fire in Seattle. The rage is real. 
Keep in mind, Tesla’s sales were already dropping before all these incidents occurred. The growing dissatisfaction has led some analysts to predict even more dire numbers for the company’s first quarter results this spring. 
It’s unclear what can turn the company’s fortunes around. Some supporters have started to openly question whether Tesla can continue to survive with Musk at the helm. But shareholders aren’t likely to jettison the controversial CEO yet, especially after voting to approve his multibillion-dollar pay package last summer. The outcome was a huge vote of confidence in Musk’s leadership — and a big validator of his behavior. 
But that was pre-DOGE, before the salute, and before the stock wipeout. Tesla’s board is clearly feeling the pinch. Chair Robyn Denholm and director James Murdoch (son of Rupert Murdoch) both sold millions of dollars’ worth of shares in the past month. 
A lot rests on Musk’s promises of a cheaper Tesla, a next-generation vehicle platform, and an actual working robotaxi service. President Trump can buy all the Teslas he wants, but if Tesla’s future is built on a bunch of falsehoods and fantasies, it’s unlikely the company can emerge from this fire unscathed.

Since early February, Tesla has been the target of protesters opposed to CEO Elon Musk’s unprecedented takeover of the federal government. As Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) eliminates humanitarian aid programs and fires tens of thousands of government workers, demonstrators are expressing their rage by picketing Tesla showrooms and demanding Tesla owners sell their vehicles.
Others have taken things further, defacing Tesla vehicles with anti-Musk slogans, smashing windows, and even setting some Tesla property on fire. Musk’s allies in the Trump administration are threatening to prosecute anyone caught defacing Tesla vehicles by classifying the acts as “domestic terrorism.“
Meanwhile, Tesla stock is on a rollercoaster, and investors are wondering when they can expect Musk to end his side quest with the government and get back to business making cars and preparing Tesla for a more uncertain future.
Read on below as we keep track of all the chaos that’s embroiling Tesla.

Amid growing fallout over Elon Musk’s involvement in the Trump administration, Tesla’s sales fell a staggering 13 percent in the first quarter of 2025 year over year. 
The company said it produced a total of 362,615 vehicles in the first three months of the year, including 345,454 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles and 17,161 “other vehicles,” which includes the Model S, Model X, and Cybertruck. Tesla also said it delivered a total of 336,681 vehicles, including 323,800 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles and 12,881 other vehicles — a 12.9 percent decline compared to Q1 2024. (For a direct-to-consumer company like Tesla, deliveries are a proxy for sales.)
The Verge
Thousands of anti-Tesla protesters took to the streets Saturday March 29th in opposition to Elon Musk and his efforts with DOGE to eliminate humanitarian aid, close federal agencies, and fire government workers. It was the culmination of nearly two months of steady, almost daily demonstrations aimed at hurting Tesla’s sales — and ultimately Musk himself. Today was billed as a “Global Day of Action” with protests targeting hundreds of Tesla locations in the US, Canada, and Europe.
The Verge wanted to check the temperature and see how these protesters were thinking about this current moment, and whether they felt their boycott was having its desired effect. Tesla sales have slid significantly since the protests started, and its stock has shed a lot of its value. But Musk shows no signs of being deterred, as he ramps up his threats to sic the government on anti-Tesla forces.

Is Tesla really cooked? Watch as The Verge transportation editor, Andrew Hawkins, walks us through how Elon Musk’s unprecedented takeover of the federal government has transformed public opinion of his car company into something increasingly toxic instead of futuristic, with some owners suddenly selling their cars even at a loss.

An arrest has been made in connection with a recent incident where someone wearing all black threw Molotov cocktails at vehicles and spray painted “resist” on the doors of a Tesla collision center in Las Vegas.
As reported earlier by the Las Vegas Review-Journal and other outlets, Paul Hyon Kim has been arrested and is facing charges including arson as well as the destruction of property, and law enforcement officials said he would also be booked on federal charges later today.

The company’s sales in January and February are down nearly 43 percent year over year, according to new registration data from the EU. Meanwhile, overall electric vehicle registrations are up 28 percent across the continent, as EVs capture 15.2 percent of total EU market share. People still really like EVs, just not the one associated with Elon Musk.

A report in the New York Post on Monday revealed the existence of a new 10-person FBI task force focused on vandalism and other activity aimed toward Tesla in response to the actions of Elon Musk. 
Like Attorney General Pam Bondi’s re-announcement last week of old charges against people accused of targeting Tesla locations for vandalism and arson, today’s announcement didn’t come with specific new details. It did come with more statements calling the acts “domestic terrorism,” a line pushed by Musk, Trump, and others in recent weeks. FBI Director Kash Patel repeated the phrase while sharing the story on X, also saying, “The FBI has been investigating the increase in violent activity toward Tesla, and over the last few days, we have taken additional steps to crack down and coordinate our response.”

At a surprise all-hands-on meeting Thursday night in Texas, Tesla CEO Elon Musk rallied up his company’s employees as the brand’s public reputation continues to plummet, Business Insider reports. At the livestreamed meeting, Musk told employees to “hang on to your stock” – which declined in value by 50 percent since December – and promised big things are coming for its Cybercab robotaxi and Optimus humanoid robot.
Musk deflected on the stock drop at the meeting and reiterated promises that Tesla’s autonomous software used for its vehicles’ so-called Full Self-Driving feature, robotaxis, and Optimus bots would bring the company’s value to new heights. “It’s so profound and there’s no comparison with anything in the past,” Musk said. He says they can make about 5,000 Optimus robots this year. “I think we will literally build a legion, at least one legion of robots this year and then probably 10 legions next year,” Musk said.
Richard Lawler
As reports of vandalism and even a supposed doxing website targeting Tesla locations and vehicles continue to appear, Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a new warning about old crimes. In a Department of Justice press release, she “announced charges against three individuals responsible for the violent destruction of Tesla properties.”
It didn’t mention that all of the arrests and charges listed had already been reported days or weeks ago.

Tesla has issued a recall for 46,096 Cybertrucks in the US to fix a fault that was causing the steel trim on some vehicles to come loose or fly off while driving. The recall applies to every Cybertruck manufactured between November 13th, 2023, and February 27th, 2025, according to the report filed with the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), with around one percent of the impacted vehicles believed to have the trim defect.
This is the eighth recall for the Cybertruck since it launched in December 2023. A similar recall was issued last summer regarding a trim fault in the truck bed that also risked coming loose and creating road hazards. The latest issue has been reported directly to the NHTSA by several Cybertruck owners, alongside being documented online in Cybertruck owner’s forums and teardown videos posted to YouTube by Reid Tomasko and Cody Detwiler.

Today we’re talking about the protests against Tesla, which have been branded on social media under the hashtag Tesla Takedown. The protests are, of course, a reaction to Elon Musk, who has managed to install himself as basically a not-so-shadow president who is tearing the federal government apart, leaving confusion and destruction in his wake. 
A lot of people are deeply unhappy with this state of affairs. And because Musk is not an elected official but is, on some level, a car salesman, many of those frustrated and angry people are taking aim at the most visible and accessible symbol of his power and wealth: Tesla itself.
Andrew J. Hawkins
Tesla protesters are planning their “biggest day of action” yet, aiming for 500 demonstrations at Tesla showrooms across the world on March 29th, organizers said during a mobilizing call Wednesday.
The protests started at a handful of Tesla locations in early February, and has grown to hundreds of locations across the world, as more people have come out to demonstrate against CEO Elon Musk’s dismantling of the federal government. Waving signs and chanting slogans, the so-called Tesla Takedown protesters have become a flashpoint for opposition to Musk’s actions to eliminate federal aid programs and fire tens of thousands of government employees as the head of DOGE, or the Department of Government Efficiency.

A month of anti-Tesla dissent escalated this week with two reports of Teslas catching fire in Las Vegas and Kansas City. 
The first incident happened early Tuesday morning at a Tesla collision center in Las Vegas, where police say a suspect in all-black gear hit several vehicles with Molotov cocktails and three bullets and painted the word “resist” on the doors of the facility, as reported earlier by the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

Briefly, here’s what’s up with Tesla over the past few weeks: its stock is down more than 50 percent since December; Tesla sales in California are plummeting; Cybertruck deliveries are reportedly paused because the vehicles are falling apart; protesters are demonstrating outside Tesla showrooms across the country; and Tesla owners are selling their cars to avoid getting called Nazis.
But that’s not all. According to data from YouGov, a market research firm, the public’s impression of the company has never been worse, reaching its lowest point since YouGov began tracking Tesla in 2016. YouGov asks members of the public daily questions about Tesla to gauge overall sentiment. (Sherwood first reported the data.)

At a White House event where he promised to buy a Tesla, President Donald Trump says he’ll label violence at Tesla locations as domestic terrorism.
Over the past few weeks, protests against Tesla CEO and Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) head Elon Musk have escalated at Tesla locations. There have been reports of situations like gunshots at a Tesla dealership and vandalism aimed at Tesla.
Emma Roth
This weekend, protests escalated at Tesla showrooms across the nation. Hundreds of people gathered to boycott Elon Musk and his involvement in the Trump administration as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is overseeing a massively disruptive effort to fire thousands of federal workers to slash government spending.
Most of these protests are associated with the Tesla Takedown movement that first emerged in February. It encourages supporters to “sell your Teslas, dump your stock, join the picket lines” as part of efforts to “stop Musk.” But momentum has ramped up significantly in the past week, leading to bigger turnouts and some arrests.

On a recent Saturday afternoon, around 50 sign-wielding protesters stood outside the Tesla showroom in Manhattan’s Meatpacking neighborhood, screaming insults at passing Tesla vehicles. 
“Uncool car!” 
Andrew J. Hawkins
Protestors are planning more demonstrations outside Tesla showrooms nationwide this weekend, as Elon Musk’s polarizing behavior and political activities within the Trump administration continue to have negative side effects on his electric car business.
The protests are being advertised on BlueSky under the tags “Tesla Takeover” and “Tesla Takedown,” similar to demonstrations held last weekend. At least three dozen events are listed on Action Network’s website, with a banner urging people who own Tesla vehicles or stock in the company to divest, sell their vehicle, and “join the picket line.”
Wes Davis
Elon Musk’s role in carrying out President Donald Trump’s dirty work has triggered a wave of opposition that is spilling over into protests against his flagship company, Tesla. Over the last week, some people have held demonstrations while others have vandalized Tesla vehicles owned by individual buyers and showrooms — with actions stretching from New York, Colorado, and California, to as far as The Netherlands and Germany. 
Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has accessed sensitive government data and cut congressionally mandated funds to agencies. After court orders demanded a halt to some of its actions, Musk and Vice President JD Vance have hinted they may ignore the rulings. Tesla’s hundreds of showrooms, as well as other locations, present a ripe target for venting frustrations about Musk’s political activities.

The Tesla Takedown movement is rallying against Elon Musk, and it’s only getting bigger.
by  Nilay Patel
Today we’re talking about the protests against Tesla, which have been branded on social media under the hashtag Tesla Takedown. The protests are, of course, a reaction to Elon Musk, who has managed to install himself as basically a not-so-shadow president who is tearing the federal government apart, leaving confusion and destruction in his wake. 
A lot of people are deeply unhappy with this state of affairs. And because Musk is not an elected official but is, on some level, a car salesman, many of those frustrated and angry people are taking aim at the most visible and accessible symbol of his power and wealth: Tesla itself.
There are protests at Tesla showrooms and charging stations every weekend now, and they’re only getting bigger — and attracting police presence and threats of prosecution from the government. President Donald Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi have said that any violence aimed at Tesla vehicles or property would be prosecuted as domestic terrorism. This is very Trump, in that there is not actually a specific federal domestic terrorism law, but you know… Trump.
In any case, these protests seem like they’re working; Tesla’s stock price has been sinking, new car registrations are down, and merely owning one has become uncomfortably political for a lot of people. We’re also seeing the hype around the company fading in ways that are frankly surprising — popular YouTubers are pointing out that vehicles like the Cybertruck simply aren’t very good and that Tesla’s missed ship dates and big claims about the capabilities of its self-driving tech don’t really hold up. And if the hype fades enough, it’s possible to break Tesla itself — it’s sky-high stock price is entirely based on hype, after all.
To help pull this all apart, I asked Ed Niedermeyer to join me on the show. Niedermeyer published a book about Tesla in 2019 called Ludicrous: The Unvarnished Story of Tesla Motors, and he hosts a podcast called Autonocast, about autonomous vehicle technology. His sizable following on Bluesky has also made him one of the leading organizers of the Tesla protests in Portland, Oregon, where he lives. So I wanted to bring him on the show to talk me through what he sees with both the big picture of Tesla as a company and on the ground with the ongoing protest movement.
There’s a lot happening and the story is changing fast, even since Niedermeyer and I talked at the beginning of the week. But that bigger picture — the disconnect between what he calls the “myth” of Tesla and the reality, and how that reality is now manifesting into a global protest movement — is shaping up to be the defining story of Tesla’s next chapter.

﻿But in a scary voice this time.

As reports of vandalism and even a supposed doxing website targeting Tesla locations and vehicles continue to appear, Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a new warning about old crimes. In a Department of Justice press release, she “announced charges against three individuals responsible for the violent destruction of Tesla properties.”
It didn’t mention that all of the arrests and charges listed had already been reported days or weeks ago.
The charges Bondi touted as evidence that “The days of committing crimes without consequence have ended” include three alleged attackers using Molotov cocktails.
Lucy Nelson is facing malicious destruction of property and firearms charges filed on March 5th in Colorado. Adam Lansky was charged on March 5th in Oregon with illegally possessing an unregistered destructive device. Daniel Clarke-Pounder was arrested and charged on March 14th in relation to an arson a week earlier at a Tesla charging station in South Carolina.
If Bondi has any new news or information about the investigations into “those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes,” that she referenced after fires in Las Vegas and Kansas City, she hasn’t released it, choosing instead to rely on the previously announced arrests to drum up new headlines. The newest information about the crimes that we found is a report by 404 Media that looked into the indictments, showing how law enforcement used license plate readers and social media posts to help identify suspects.

The FBI is reportedly looking into incidents of vandalism and arson, and ‘tracking’ the planned Tesla Takedown protests.
by  Richard Lawler
A report in the New York Post on Monday revealed the existence of a new 10-person FBI task force focused on vandalism and other activity aimed toward Tesla in response to the actions of Elon Musk. 
Like Attorney General Pam Bondi’s re-announcement last week of old charges against people accused of targeting Tesla locations for vandalism and arson, today’s announcement didn’t come with specific new details. It did come with more statements calling the acts “domestic terrorism,” a line pushed by Musk, Trump, and others in recent weeks. FBI Director Kash Patel repeated the phrase while sharing the story on X, also saying, “The FBI has been investigating the increase in violent activity toward Tesla, and over the last few days, we have taken additional steps to crack down and coordinate our response.” 
Unlike international groups branded as terrorism that the US government can bar support for, the US doesn’t have a similar formal designation for domestic terrorist groups. A recent report by Wired cites civil liberties experts who said possible effects of the designation could give law enforcement more surveillance authority over Musk protestors and possibly the ability to share information from investigations with Musk and Tesla.
CNBC reports that earlier on Monday, police said they’d found multiple “incendiary devices” at a Tesla showroom in Austin, Texas. The Post article also said the task force is “tracking” the “Tesla Takedown” mass protests scheduled for March 29th and looking into a “Dogeque.st” site that claimed to dox some Tesla owners and locations, which it said appears to be run out of Sao Tome, the second-smallest country in Africa. 404 Media reports that after going offline the same day it appeared, a version of the site has reappeared on the dark web.

                            <h3>Tesla Got a Permit to Operate a Taxi Service in California—but There's a Catch</h3>
                            <p><strong>Content:</strong> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-got-a-permit-to-operate-a-taxi-service-in-california-but-theres-a-catch/" target="_blank">https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-got-a-permit-to-operate-a-taxi-service-in-california-but-theres-a-catch/</a></p>
                            <p><strong>Article Content:</strong> Tesla has been granted a permit to operate a taxi service in California, a spokesperson for the California Public Utilities Commission, a state regulator, said Tuesday. It marks the first step towards Tesla’s and CEO Elon Musk’s vision of operating a driverless taxi service in the state.
One day, Musk has said, Tesla owners should be able to rent out their cars as sort of self-driving Ubers while they’re not using them. He has said current owners should be able to operate their Models 3 and Y autonomously in the state later this year—a plan that faces both technological and regulatory hurdles.
But despite the permit, Tesla’s driverless taxi future still seems far off in California, which has the perfect climate for self-driving cars but some of the strictest regulatory requirements in the US for testing and operating them. The permit does not allow Tesla to transport passengers in driverless cars; CPUC spokesperson Terrie Prosper says that the electric carmaker did not apply for its autonomous vehicle programs. Tesla wouldn't be granted such a permit anyway, because it first needs to receive permission from another state regulator, the Department of Motor Services, to offer driverless rides. (The DMV confirmed to WIRED that Tesla has not applied for the necessary permits.)
The new permit does allow Tesla to operate a taxi service comprising vehicles with drivers, who will be Tesla employees, according to the CPUC. Initially, the regulator says, Tesla will use the permit to take only Tesla employees on prearranged trips, though it plans to eventually give rides to members of the public.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the permit, or its future driverless plans in California.
Four companies, including Amazon’s Zoox, hold permits allowing them to operate some kind of driverless service pilot in the state, though two of those companies are only permitted to offer rides with a driver behind the wheel. Only Waymo operates driverless taxis in California. The Google sister company, which took a longer and more cautious approach to self-driving service, spent more than a decade moving from testing early versions of its driverless technology on public roads to running a paid robotaxi service in Phoenix, Arizona. Today, Waymo operates service in four cities: Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin.
Tesla has explored launching a driverless taxi service in at least Palo Alto, Palo Alto Online first reported last year. Emails later obtained by WIRED show that, by late October of last year, Tesla Autopilot head Ashok Elluswamy was negotiating with city council and staff members over how to pull off such a service. Tesla had hoped to launch by taking over the same permit used by another company, Via, that provided shuttle services in California. Eventually, according to the emails, the automaker concluded that it had to apply for its own permit.
A spokesperson for the City of Palo Alto did not immediately respond to questions about how the new permit might affect robotaxi plans in the area.
Musk said earlier this year that Tesla plans to launch a driverless taxi service in Austin, Texas, this coming June. (Unlike California, Texas has no strict rules around autonomous vehicle operations.) Last fall, the automaker showed off a prototype of its “Cybercab,” a two-seat, purpose-built robotaxi, which it said it would begin to produce in 2026.
Whatever happens in Texas this year, Musk and his company have already missed a few deadlines. In 2019, he said the automaker would have 1 million robotaxis on the road by the following year.

Ford has dealt with delays and supply shortages in getting NACS adapters to customers.

Ford is making some changes to how it handles its EV charging accessories.
The company was the first to announce its plans to adopt Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS) connector for its EVs, and was also first to distribute NACS adapters to its EV customers free of charge. But now that grace period is over, with Ford announcing that it has finally shipped adapters to all 140,000 customers that reserved one.
Starting today, anyone that needs a NACS adapter will have to shell out $200. The adapters were co-developed by Ford and Lectron, and are rated for up to 500 amps and 1,000 volts. The adapters went through a battery of tests, including being run over by a truck and submerging them in water, to be sure they were up to the task of connecting Ford EVs to Tesla Superchargers.
Starting today, anyone that needs a NACS adapter will have to shell out $200.
Ford has been struggling with delays and recalls in getting its adapters to customers. The deadline to receive a complimentary adapter was extended several times. And Ford also had tell its customers to stop using the adapter after discovering an issue with the charging speed. (Lectron said only a small batch of adapters were effected.) To deal with these shortages, Ford started offering its own Lectron-developed adapters last year as it waited for Tesla’s supply to catch up.
In a blog post, Ford’s head of charging and energy service Ken Williams extended his gratitude to everyone who waited for a complimentary charger: “Every complimentary adapter reserved by our U.S. customers has been shipped. From customer reservation No. 1 in Austin, Texas, to customer reservation #139,936 in Waconia, Minnesota, we are truly grateful for those who have charged with us (and patiently waited for us).”
Ford also touted the growth of its BlueOval Charging Network, which now includes Tesla’s Supercharger destinations as among the stations where Ford EV owners can pay for charging using their Ford Pass app. The network now includes more than 180,000 chargers at more than 50,000 charging locations, representing a 40 percent increase from early 2024.
The company is making other updates to help its customers use Tesla’s EV charging stations. EV owners who use Apple Maps via CarPlay will now be routed to nearby Superchargers when planning a trip that will require charging, Ford said.

                            <p><strong>Content:</strong> <a href="https://gizmodo.com/elon-fiddles-while-tesla-dealerships-burn-2000582885" target="_blank">https://gizmodo.com/elon-fiddles-while-tesla-dealerships-burn-2000582885</a></p>
                            <p><strong>Article Content:</strong> A Tesla dealership in Rome caught fire over the weekend, leaving behind the burned out husks of 17 of the vehicles. Police in Italy are investigating the fire as an act of arson. While one of his dealerships burned, Tesla CEO and shadow-president Elon Musk showed charts and graphs on stage in Wisconsin ahead of an election there. As Tesla literally burns, its CEO is everywhere but in the boardroom.
Digos, Italy’s anti-terrorism cops, are investigating the arson in Rome. In early conversations with the press, Digos said it’s possible that a group of anarchists set fire to the Teslas but nothing is confirmed. The fire department said that the blaze started around 4:30 a.m., destroyed 17 cars, and damaged the building where they were housed.
Musk’s relationship with Donald Trump is hurting his business, he’s admitted as much in weepy interviews on Fox News. While he stood on a stage and gave away cash prizes in Wisconsin, people gathered at Tesla dealerships in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. More than 150 people showed up at one anti-Musk gathering in Chicago. Three hundred were at a protest in Syracuse, New York. In a Boston suburb, 600 showed up to protest Musk. In Berlin, someone covered the front of a dealership in blue paint.
Tesla’s stock price has lost 50% of its value since December. It’s been up and down over the past few days but has not recovered anything approaching its pre-inauguration highs. It slipped again on Monday morning when trading started. First-quarter deliveries are expected to be way down, both because of Trump’s economic policies and Musk’s fading star.
Tesla’s brand is so bad that Alset Auto, a company that sells Tesla and Cybertruck wraps, is running an ad that capitalizes on the chaos. In the ad, an Alset employee fields several calls from Tesla owners looking to protect their cars from eggs, paint, and other damage. “Yes ma’am, ceramic coating will protect your Tesla’s paint from offensive graffiti but we can’t do anything about you getting the finger,” he says over footage of someone spray painting “FUCK ELON” on the car.”
In the ad, another caller puts on a cowboy hat and sunglasses and stares wearily over their shoulder. “So you want us to limo-tint your windows so no one recognizes you driving it? Yeah, we can do that,” the worker says. He takes another call. “So you want us to make a custom bumper sticker that reads: ‘I knew Elon was nuts, but not this nuts. I’d sell my Tesla but it’s depreciated so much I have negative equity on my loan?’”
The fire in Rome isn’t the first one to sweep a Tesla dealership. A few weeks ago someone threw a Molotov cocktail at a Tesla facility in Las Vegas and damaged five of the vehicles then began shooting at some of the vehicles.
Days after the incident, the FBI announced it had created a task force to “crack down on Violent Tesla attacks.” FBI Director Kash Patel called the various incidents of vandalism and destruction of Tesla vehicles terrorism. “This is domestic terrorism. Those responsible will be pursued, caught, and brought to justice,” Patel said on March 24.
Patel and the FBI’s task force did nothing to diminish the anti-Musk protests over the weekend.

The road to progress has never been smooth. Witness, as a metaphor, the trials and tribulations of the Ford Motor Company as it has tried to sell electric vehicle drivers the premier charging experience: an easy, friction-free, and maybe even delightful pit stop that might convince even more buyers to dump their gas-guzzlers for the plug.
However, Ford announced today that, a year after saying it would give away electric vehicle charging adapters to qualifying customers, it has finally made good on this promise.
Ford says it has sent out 140,000 fast-charging adapters, allowing thousands of model year 2021 to 2024 Mach-E and Lighting drivers to access the Tesla Supercharger network. Now customers have access to 44,000 fast chargers across North America—up 53 percent from a year ago—which can charge up a car in as little as 20 minutes. In total, North American Ford drivers can now access 180,000 chargers, which the company says makes it the continent’s largest integrated public charging network.
Before the 2-pound adapter could show up in drivers’ mailboxes, Ford went through a nearly two-year odyssey of changes, delays, a few manufacturing missteps, and a low-grade kerfuffle with Tesla, still the country’s most dominant EV manufacturer. The whole thing is a microcosm of the wider challenges that face car manufacturers as they attempt to ride the whims of global markets and policy to transition to electric vehicles. It echoes, too, Ford’s stop-starts in its own EV rollout, which have included production delays and pauses, difficulty in bringing down the costs of production, and last summer’s announcement that the company would rejigger its electrification strategy to emphasize hybrids over battery-electrics, canceling one electric SUV and delaying another EV in the process.
Ford says getting this adapter and public charging right is vital because most of the company’s EV customers are now people switching from gas-powered cars. "We know that making the charging experience work better is just going to make them feel better about their purchase,” says CEO Jim Farley. Hooking up with Tesla’s Supercharger network, long regarded as the most reliable and built-out in the US, is part of the automaker’s strategy to get more people into EVs.
Nationally, though, public charging still has issues. Last month, the federal government paused a national program to build out a robust charging station network across the US. A recent survey from JD Power found that one in five of the EV drivers who visited public charging stations in the last three months of 2024 were unable to charge, due to station outages, long wait times, payment failures, and broken equipment. Vandalism has also been an issue; Tesla has confirmed it is testing a product called "DyeDefender" that sprays blue-staining dye on anyone who attempts to cut its charging cables.
Vehicle shoppers’ top three barriers to an EV purchase, the survey said, are charging-related: a lack of charging availability; the longer times required to charge up; and limited battery range. “If someone feels like the public charging infrastructure isn’t supportive enough, they might opt for an ICE vehicle,” says Brent Gruber, the head of the EV practice at JD Power, referring to internal combustion engines.
Ford’s attempt to solve these issues started in 2023. The Supercharger network has long been seen as one of Tesla’s great advantages, and drivers say the Tesla charger, now called the North American Charging Standard (NACS), is preferable because its connectors are lighter and easier to handle, and because the technology tends to work the first time it plugs in.
So Farley asked chief EV, digital, and design officer Doug Field—a former engineering head at Tesla—to ask the electric automaker about access to the Supercharger network. Tesla said no. Then Farley started a “complimentary” exchange with Tesla CEO Elon Musk on X, which turned into texting.
“We eventually settled on something,” Farley says. Ford became the first non-Tesla automaker to announce that it would use NACS. The first Fords with built-in NACS connectors will come in 2026; for now, drivers will depend on their free adapters. (Replacements are $200 a pop.)
Ford's Supercharger adapter.
When Ford said last year that its adapters would be free, the company was initially surprised by the customer enthusiasm for the product. Tesla was set to manufacture the Ford NACS adapters. But by mid-summer, Ford customers were flooding online forums with complaints of adapter delays, and Ford decided Tesla wasn’t quite moving fast enough, especially given the number needed.
“We have a certain amount of patience, but given that this is something we promised our customers, we don't have unlimited patience,” Farley says. So Ford switched to Lectron, which manufactures EV chargers and adapters.
NACS is open source, but officials with Lectron and Ford said the companies still had plenty of quick work to do to make sure that the Ford-branded adapter could survive in the real world. The companies tested the adapter in extreme cold and heat. Ford assumed its customers would beat up the thing—dropping it, slamming it, accidentally rolling over it with their EVs, which can weigh nearly 7,000 pounds—and it tested the adapter to make sure it could survive. The team decided at one point that the adapter’s latch wasn’t up to snuff, so transitioned it from zinc alloy to stainless steel.
One special manufacturing challenge was proofing the adapter against water, says Christopher Maiwald, the founder and CEO of Lectron. The firm wanted the adapter to survive for up to 30 minutes in more than 3 feet of water, but also to survive more than 10,000 insertions. “We learned a lot about sealing implementation,” says Maiwald. The whole thing was hard work. “It seems really quite mundane, but once you go into the details and understand how much learning and a little bit of suffering went into this, it’s really quite beautiful,” he says.
In October, Ford advised a number of customers to stop using their adapters; the affected products were manufactured by Tesla, Maiwald says. Ford confirmed Lectron wasn't responsible for the issue, but declined to specify Tesla's role. Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Indeed, the T-word looms large over not just this adapter project but the entire electric vehicle industry. In the US, protesters dismayed by CEO Elon Musk’s role in the Trump administration have gathered outside Tesla showrooms, service centers, and charging stations. (Now that at least eight automakers’ vehicles have access to the Tesla charging network, the protests could make more than Tesla drivers uncomfortable.) Tesla sales have fallen off a cliff in Europe, thanks in part to Musk’s reputation and the new dominance of Chinese EV automakers. Sales have also fallen in the US, though not as dramatically.
Farley calls Ford a “hungry” number two in US EV sales, but he mostly demurs when asked whether Tesla’s new role in politics might lead to changes on the EV leaderboard. “I've seen many, many companies have crises of reputation, but their consumer products are separated from their reputation, and they and customers are willing to separate the two,” he says.
“What I've learned over time is that the company should be really focused on what it can control,” says Farley. He’s talking, in part, about his company's incoming lineup of affordable EVs, due out in 2027, to compete with already announced offerings from the likes of VW, Kia and Hyundai. Whether the charging network, accessed via a Tesla adaptor or not, is there to tempt consumers to convert in sufficient quantities remains to be seen.

America’s favorite low poly electric truck is facing a new set of problems that don’t have anything to do with people spray painting swastikas or crude comments about Elon Musk on them. Deliveries of the Tesla Cybertruck are on hold while the company addresses issues with reports that the trim is becoming detached and flying off, Electrek reports.
Tesla service representatives are telling customers awaiting deliveries that there is a “containment hold” on their trucks, according to several posts in the Cybertruck Owners Forum, as noted by Electrek. The customers are not being told it has anything to do with the vehicle’s trim, though. A containment hold is a proactive measure taken by automakers to address a quality issue or defect with a vehicle before it reaches customers.
Electrek also shared a screenshot of direct messages between a customer and a Tesla service rep that mentioned an issue with the truck’s cantrail, or the decorative trim that covers the roof ledge above the door. The delay could take several weeks to address, depending on the severity of the loose trim.
The problem is likely related to a handful complaints filed with the federal government earlier this year, which noted that the trim above the truck’s windows appeared to be attached by glue.

A video on YouTube posted over a month ago goes into greater detail about the issues with the cantrail trim.
This isn’t the first time we’re hearing about problems with the Cybertruck trim. Tesla issued a recall for over 11,000 trucks last summer for “improperly adhered… trunk bed trim sail applique.”
The Cybertruck has been recalled seven times since its official launch December 2023. Tesla sold an estimated 40,000 trucks in 2024, despite over 1 million reservations. There were anecdotal reports of Cybertrucks piling up on used car lots. Tesla Cybertruck factory workers in Austin were told to stay home for three days in December. And since Elon Musk’s elevation as a special advisor to the Trump administration, the Cybertruck has become a target of graffitti and vandalism from people opposed to Musk’s takeover of the federal government.
